Developers on IRC
=================

Some of the Crawl developers hang out on the ##crawl-dev IRC channel on
freenode (irc://freenode/##crawl-dev).  You can ask them development related
questions.  Also, users with +v have commit access, so if you have a patch
which is ready to commit you can poke them about it.

Chatzilla and Crawl's bug tracking system
=========================================

If you're using Chatzilla as your IRC client, you can make Chatzilla
automatically link references to "bug NNN" or "bug #NNN" to Crawl
bug tracker.  Simply open preferences, chose the ##craw-dev view,
select the appearances tab, and set "Bugzilla URL" to

    http://crawl.develz.org/mantis/view.php?id=%s

(Note that even though the option is called "Bugzilla URL", Crawl doesn't use
Bugzilla for bug/issue tracking, but Mantis)
