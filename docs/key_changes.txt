    DUNGEON CRAWL: Important interface changes
    ==========================================

Command key changes introduced in 0.5
-------------------------------------
There have been some command key changes in 0.5. There is no macrofile this
time; you may have to resort to macros on your own. (This is probably only
needed to interchange the Z and V commands if you refuse to learn that wands
are nowadays activated with V.)
            key        new command
            V          evokes items in inventory like wands (was Z)
            Z          cast a spell even if no monster is within range
            z          cast a spell (as before) but abort if no monster is
                       within range
            Ctrl-X     lists monsters, items and features in sight
            Ctrl-S     saves game without prompt (was Ctrl-X)

            On the level map (X):
            e          set/remove travel exclusion (was Ctrl-X)
            E          cycle travel exclusions (was x)



Command key changes introduced in 0.4
-------------------------------------
In DCSS 0.4, for better ergonomics, many key bindings were changed. Also, a
small number of new commands were introduced. The tables below list all of
these. If you have been playing an older version and want to restore the old
key set, do so by adding this line to the init.txt file:
  additional_macro_file = 034_command_keys.txt

The command for examining items (was v) is gone. Bring up the inventory and
press the key matching an item's slot in order to examine it.
When chopping up a single corpse on the ground, there is no longer any prompt.
You will only be prompted if there are two or more corpses. When answering this
prompt, you can use the following shortcuts: c means yes, so you can press
cccc... to chop up all corpses in one place, or you can just hit a to butcher
of corpses on a square.

The * Direction and Ctrl-Direction keys now both open and close doors.
                 key         new command
                             read message (only used for online play)
                 !           annotate level (read annotations with Ctrl-O;
                             annotations with an ! prompt when entering the level)
                 (           cycle ammunition
                 Q           quiver item
                 â€˜           redo previous command
                 0           repeat next command
                 V           verbose list of monsters in sight
                 Ctrl-T      toggle ally pickup mode (only for permanent allies)
                 Ctrl-D      add macro (a new synonym for ~)
                 new key     command                   old key
                 z           cast spell                was Z
                 Z           zap wand                  was z
                 o           auto-explore              was Ctrl-O
                 Ctrl-O      dungeon overview          was O
                 O           open door                 was o
                 C           close door                was c
                 c           chop up                   was D, dissect
                 E           show experience           was C
                 v           evoke                     was E
                 F           manually throw            was t
                 t           tell/yell                 was !
                 Ctrl-V      Tiles settings            was Ctrl-Q
                 Ctrl-Q      quit                      was Q

There are additional changes to the targeting interface:
The functions of ! and . have been swapped. So firing with . will now stop at
the target, whereas ! will shoot further if the target was missed (and Enter,
Del, Space still behave as in 0.3.4).
You can now target using the monster list as well; Ctrl-L toggles this option.
You may quiver an item, meaning that you will preferably fire this ammunition
(and keep doing so even if you run out of it temporarily). Quivering is done
via Q (quiver the currently fired item) or fi (choose an item and quiver it) or
also by using ( (cycling appropriate ammunition) and then firing. F also lets
you select an item to be thrown, but this command does not affect the quiver.

Other interface changes introduced in 0.4
-----------------------------------------
The colours of many monsters have been changed. Most notably, there are no
darkgrey monsters anymore. In case darkgrey is actually better visible than
blue on your system, you can swap these colours using the line
    colour.blue = darkgrey
in init.txt. Apart from that, more dangerous monsters are now generally
displayed in lighter colours.

We are content that all of these changes are genuine improvements. Should your
brain be hardwired to the old settings, you can effectively enforce the 0.3.4
state by using the following options:
    include                            = 034_monster_glyphs.txt
    additional_macro_file              = 034_command_keys.txt
    always_confirm_butcher             = true

Note that the header of init.txt contains these lines. (It contains some more
options for using other old settings.) The options are commented out, so you
just need to remove the # in front in order to activate them. You can choose to
use only part of these options. In case you decide to use the old keyset, be
aware that D and d are synonyms for 'yes' in the butcher interface.
