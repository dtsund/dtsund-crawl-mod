A.                                OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of games like Rogue, Hack and Moria.
Your objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave complex and retrieve
the Orb of Zot, which is guarded by many horrible and hideous creatures.

If you have never played Crawl (or a similar game) before, you may want to pick
the tutorial from the starting menu. The tutorial explains the interface in
five easy lessons. Once you're familiar with the controls, you may want to play
a few games in hints mode.

Detailed instructions for playing Crawl follow. To simplify this manual, we
assume that you use the standard distribution and that you've not changed the
default options. If you don't want to read the whole manual and would prefer a
short summary of the important points, look at the quick-start guide
(quickstart.txt) and learn as you play.

You can also read these documents while playing Crawl by hitting '?' at the
help menu. There is also a list of frequently asked questions about gameplay and
design, best accessed by pressing '?Q' in the game.

There is also an IRC channel dedicated to Crawl Light at #CrawlLight on freenode.
You can ask for help and there will always be someone to supervise your game and
give hints if you happen to play on a server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.                             STARTING SCREEN
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After starting Crawl, you'll be asked to type in a name. Press Enter if you wish
to choose a name after deciding on the species and background of your new
character. The full list of saved games is also displayed, which you can
navigate with the cursor Up and Down keys, and entering a name that is already
attached to a save game will continue that game. Otherwise, enter a new name,
and you will proceed to choose a species and background for a new character.

You can make these two choices in either order, and you can randomise your
choice of background, species, or both if you would rather have the game decide
for you. If both are randomised, you will be prompted with the chosen
combination before the game starts.

The choice of species affects several important characteristics, in particular
the speed at which you learn different skills. This is very important, and helps
to clearly differentiate the many available species. The following factors are
species-dependent:

Major:
  * Your rate of level advancement
  * Your rate of skill advancement
  * Your initial primary attributes (this also depends on background)
  * Various special abilities, powers and limitations

Minor:
  *  Occasional bonus points added to some primary attributes
  *  The amount of hit points you get each level
  *  The amount of magic points you get each level
  *  Your initial equipment (this also depends on background)

.. note:: Humans are the average to which all other species are compared.

The choice of character background is definitely less decisive than that of
species in Crawl. Basically, the background determines what the character has
learned prior to entering the dungeon (i.e. the starting skills), and also helps
determine equipment and hit/magic points at start.

Some species are slower than humans in most or all skills. For some backgrounds
these species may seem to have very few starting skills because they haven't
quite earned the first level of several of their skills (Centaurs are often
subject to this and non-human Wanderers can appear to start with no skills at
all). This isn't a bug or an oversight; these species are just particularly
weaker than humans with these backgrounds. They may have other advantages
beyond skill development, though in some cases they may not.

You will notice that a different set of backgrounds will be recommended (light
grey) for each species. Although you are free to pick any background with almost
any species (the only restrictions are for backgrounds that feature a religion
that may not be open to all species), looking at the recommended combinations
should give you a rough impression of the weaknesses and strengths of the
different species.

For some combinations of species and background, you must make further choices
before starting the game. For example, you must pick a starting book for
Conjurers and a starting weapon for Gladiators.

When you start a new character (or load an old one) and want to get a rough
impression, you may examine it with the following commands:

A
  shows any peculiarities like unusual speed or eating behaviours

m
  shows your skills and lets you switch off some if wanted

i
  the equipment

^
  the text for your god, should you have started with a religion

%
  a general, if terse, overview over your gear and most attributes

Ctrl-O
  an overview of the part of the dungeon you discovered so far

------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.                          ATTRIBUTES AND STATS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stat area to the right of the playing map shows a lot of information.
It starts with the character's name and title (determined by the character's
highest skill), followed by a line listing the species. If the character
worships a god, the name of the deity is also listed in the second line,
together with an indicator of piety. Below these two lines follow a lot of
numbers. These describe different aspects of the hero.

Health
  A measure of life force. Synonymous with hit points and sometimes abbreviated
  as HP. You die if your health drops to zero or less (although you can die in
  other ways, too). The main screen shows hit points in a particular format. If
  your character's Health is displayed as 'Health: 8/10', Crawl is actually
  showing that your character's maximum hit points are 10, while the character
  currently has 8. Usually, you regain hit points slowly over time. Pressing '5'
  or Shift-Num-5 lets you wait for a longer period. Some very battle-fixated
  characters may end up with more than 250 hit points, yet some spellcasters are
  known to have finished the game victorious with fewer than 100.

Magic
  A measure of magic or other intrinsic power. This is used primarily for
  spellcasting, but is sometimes also used for the evoking and invoking of many
  other special abilities. They are displayed in the same way as hit points;
  nothing bad happens if these drop to zero, except, of course, that you can't
  cast any spells. Resting restores these, too. It is uncommon to have more than
  50 magic points (without using external devices.)

Next come your defences. For all of them, more is better.

Armour Class
  Abbreviated to "AC". When something injures you, your AC reduces the amount of
  damage you suffer.

Evasion
  Abbreviated to "EV". This helps you avoid being hit by unpleasant things (but
  will not reduce the amount of damage you suffer if you do get hit).

Shield
  Abbreviated to "SH". This number is a measure of how good your shield (if any)
  is at blocking attacks.

Your hero's primary attributes are Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence:

Strength
  Abbreviated to "Str". Affects how much stuff you can carry and also the amount
  of damage you do in combat.

Intelligence
  Abbreviated to "Int". Affects how well you can cast spells as well as how
  much nutrition spellcasting takes. Your ability to use some magical items is
  also influenced by your intelligence.

Dexterity
  Abbreviated to "Dex". Affects your accuracy in combat, your ability to dodge
  attacks aimed at you, your general effectiveness with missile weapons, and
  your ability to use thiefly skills such as backstabbing and disarming traps.

They grow permanently from gaining levels, and may increase or decrease
temporarily from mutations or using appropriate artefacts or abilities.

If any one of these drops to zero for some reason, you will not die immediately.
But you will experience very unpleasant effects: running around with no strength
or intelligence is going to cause you problems before long, and having an
attribute reduced to such critically low levels is eventually fatal.

Upon gaining levels 3, 6, 9, etc., you may choose an attribute to raise. Most
species gain additional attributes at some levels, with the frequency and the
attribute to be increased determined by species.

The next numbers shown are Experience and the (dungeon) Level:

Experience Level
  Abbreviated to "XL". Starting characters have experience level 1; the highest
  possible level is 27. Gaining a level nets additional hit and magic points,
  and will sometimes grant spell slots or primary attributes (see below).

Experience Pool
  Abbreviated to "Exp". The Experience Pool is a number ranging between 0 and
  20000. It is increased whenever you gain experience (usually by killing
  monsters), and it is decreased by various actions, increasing the relevant
  skills commensurately. Having an eye on the Pool is important if you want to
  train specific skills. See section E for more details.

Place
  This shows the branch you are currently in, as well as the level within the
  branch. The starting branch is called Dungeon, so that the place information
  will read "Dungeon:1" for a new character.

There are some additional stats that aren't as important on a turn to turn basis
and thus aren't listed in the main stats area. They can easily be checked with
the '@' or '%' commands, though.

Magic Resistance
  Affects your ability to resist the effects of enchantments and similar magic
  directed at you. Although your magic resistance increases with your level to
  an extent determined by your character's species, the creatures you will meet
  deeper in the dungeon are better at casting spells, and are more likely to be
  able to affect you. MR is an internal variable, so you can't see what yours
  is, but you can get a rough idea by pressing '@' or '%'.

Stealth
  Another internal variable like Magic Resistance. First, there is a Stealth
  skill which every character can learn (but again, the different species'
  aptitudes for this vary greatly). Next, some armours affect stealth in a
  positive way (all Elven pieces are notable in this regard), while heavy
  armours will hamper it. High stealth allows your character to move through the
  dungeon undetected.

There are many ailments or enchantments that can temporarily befall you. These
are noted in the stats area below the experience line. Many of them are
self-explanatory, like Pray or Hungry. Many others, however, can be subtle,
and a full list with explanations is given in Appendix 5. List of
Enchantments.

Monsters within your field of vision are listed on a special panel, the monster
list. Single monsters also get indicators of their health status in the form of
a coloured box, and also on effects they enjoy or suffer from; additionally, for
those who worship The Shining One, monsters whom it would be unchivalric to
attack have their name and effect status coloured red.  Within target mode
you can directly target single monsters by use of the monster list. Use 'Ctrl-L'
to toggle this.

Sometimes characters will be able to use special abilities, e.g. the Naga's
ability to spit poison or the magical power to turn invisible granted by a
ring. These are accessed through the 'a' command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.                          EXPLORING THE DUNGEON
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Movement
========================================

You can make your character walk around with the numeric keypad (try both
Numlock on and off) or the "Rogue" keys (hjklyubn). If this is too slow, you can
make your character walk repeatedly by pressing Shift and a direction;
alternatively, press '/' followed by a direction. You will walk in that
direction until any of a number of things happen: a hostile monster is visible
on the screen, a message is sent to the message window for any reason, you press
a key, or you are about to step on anything other than normal floor or an
undiscovered trap and it is not your first move of the long walk. Note that this
is functionally equivalent to just pressing the direction key several times.

Another convenient method for moving long distances is described in the section
on Automated Travel and Exploration below.

Resting and Searching
========================================

If you press Shift and '5' on the numeric keypad (or just the number '5' on the
keyboard), you rest for 100 turns or until your hit points or magic return to
full, whichever is sooner. You can rest for just one turn by pressing '.',
Delete, 's' or '5' on the keypad. Whenever you are resting, you are assumed to
be observing your surroundings, so you have a chance of detecting any traps or
secret doors near you.

Resting stops if a monster appears or if you are otherwise interrupted.

Examining your surroundings
========================================

The section of the viewing window which is coloured (with the "@" representing
you at the centre) is what you can see around you. The dark grey around it is
the parts of the level which you have visited, but cannot currently see. The 'x'
command lets you move the cursor around to get a description of the various
dungeon features, and typing 'v' when the cursor is over a monster or feature
brings up a short description of that monster, as well as a short list of its
various strengths, weaknesses, immunities, etc. This is generally useful with
monsters you've never encountered before. You can get a map of the whole level
(which shows where you've already been) by typing 'X'.

You can see the full set of commands available while looking around by pressing
'?', both in the 'x' and 'X' modes.

Staircases and Portals
========================================

You can make your way between levels by using staircases, which appear as ">"
(down) and "<" (up), by pressing the '>' or '<' keys. It is important to know
that most monsters adjacent to you will follow when you change levels; this
holds both for hostile and allied monsters. Notable exceptions are zombies (and
other mindless undead, who are too stupid to properly operate stairs) and ghosts
(who feel they belong to their level).

If you ascend an up staircase on level one, you will leave the dungeon forever;
if you are carrying the magical Orb of Zot, you win the game by doing this.
Otherwise, the game ends, and you lose.

Besides the dungeon you start in, Crawl's dungeon has many branches. All of them
are themed and host opponents of some special sort. It is not mandatory to visit
any particular branch, but you must explore some of them: progress to the Realms
of Zot (where the Orb is located) is only possible for adventurers who have at
least three magical runes of Zot. The bottoms of several branches contain such
runes.

Occasionally you will find an archway (displayed as "\" or as an actual arch);
these lead to special places like shops, mythical labyrinths, or Hell. You can
enter it by typing '<' or '>'. A few portals only accept one of '<' and '>'.

Doors and Traps
========================================

Doors can usually be opened by just walking into them (there is an option for
disabling this); else this can also be done using the 'O' command. They can be
closed with the 'C' command. Pressing Ctrl plus a direction, or '*' followed by
a direction, will open/close doors, too.

If there is no door in the indicated space, both Ctrl-direction and
'*'-direction will attempt to attack any monster which may be standing there
(this is the only way to attack a friendly creature hand-to-hand). If there is
no creature there, you will attempt to disarm any trap in the target square. If
there is apparently nothing there, you will still attack it, just in case
there's something invisible lurking around.

A variety of dangerous and irritating traps are hidden around the dungeon. Traps
look like normal floor until discovered. Some traps can be disarmed with the
Ctrl-direction commands.

Shops
========================================

When you visit a shop, you are shown what the shopkeeper has in stock and can
choose what to buy. Unfortunately, the shopkeepers all have an exclusive deal
with the Guild of Dungeon Procurers which prevents them using non-guild labour
to obtain stock, so you can't sell anything in a shop. (But then, what
shopkeeper would buy stolen goods from a disreputable adventurer, anyway?)

You can check your inventory and the items you've identified while you are
shopping, which may help to decide if you really need that expensive item.

To purchase one or more items, select them by pressing the letters of the item
in the shop menu and then press Enter to make the purchase; you can examine
stuff before you buy it by pressing '!' and then the letter of the item.

If you've lost track of the shops in the dungeon, you can get a list of all the
shops you've found in the dungeon overview (use 'Ctrl-O').

You can also use the stash search: Hitting 'Ctrl-F' and searching for "shop"
will list all stores. The stash-search menu allows you travel quickly to a
particular shop; if you just want to know what's in the shop, you can also
examine the shop's inventory from the search menu without having to travel all
the way to the shop.

Some shops are antique stores that sell items of unknown provenance, usually at
a good discount. The dungeon overview screen displays these with yellow glyphs.

If you're short on gold for some particularly interesting commodity, you can
place it onto your shopping list. The game will interrupt you when you have
collected enough gold to finally purchase an item on that list. You can read
the shopping list in the game with '$'.

Automated Travel and Exploration
========================================

Crawl has an extensive automated travel system: pressing 'G' (or also 'Ctrl-G')
lets you choose any dungeon level; the game will then take the shortest path to
reach this destination. You can also use autotravel on the level map ('X'): Move
the cursor to the place where you want to go and hit Enter. There are several
shortcuts when choosing destinations: For example, try '<' and '>' to quickly
reach the staircases.

When your autotravel gets interrupted, Crawl will remember the previous
destination. Hitting 'G' or 'Ctrl-G' again and following with Enter puts the
cursor on that square. See Appendix 4. List of Keys and Commands for all
commands and shortcuts in level-map mode, or press 'G?' or 'X?' within the game.

Another use of autotravel is exploration: 'o' makes your character move to the
nearest unexplored area. This can be dangerous - do not use it when known
hostiles are around! Also note that this algorithm does not attempt any
optimisation: By manual exploration you can save turns, but auto-explore will
usually save real time.

If you like the use of automated exploration, take note of the option setting
'explore_greedy = true' (default setting) in the init file. This will cause
Crawl to run to and pick up all items seen which are on the autopickup list. It
also makes the character go to piles of items in order to check their contents.

Stashes and Searching
========================================

Since you can only carry 52 items, you will occasionally want to stash things
away (by dropping them with the 'd' command). When you want to search for
something in your stashes, you can do this with the Find command 'Ctrl-F'. The
parser even accepts regular expressions, although you will mostly just need
strings like 'mutation', 'heal wounds', etc. You will be presented with a list
of all places where objects matching the search are (or have been) located; you
can then travel there or examine the pile. The Find command will also search in
shop inventories. Furthermore, you can search skills like 'long blades' (this
will find all weapons training the long blades skill) or general terms like
'shop', 'altar', 'portal', 'artefact', 'dart trap', etc.
You can get help on finding by pressing '?' at the prompt.

The Goal
========================================

Your goal is to locate the Orb of Zot, which is held somewhere deep beneath the
world's surface. The Orb is an ancient and incredibly powerful artefact, and the
legends promise great things for anyone brave enough to extract it from the
fearsome Dungeon. Some say it will grant immortality or even godhood to the one
who carries it into the sunlight; many undead creatures seek it in the hope that
it will restore them to life. But then, some people will believe anything. Good
luck!

Further Help
========================================

To access Crawl's help menu, press '?'. To get the list of all commands, press
'?' again. A different, more verbose description of the commands also appears in
Appendix 4. List of Keys and Commands of this text. Various other help texts
are available as well, including this manual. You can also read the logbook from
there by pressing ':'. Note that several commands have their own help screens,
among them are targeting ('f'), level map ('X'), travel ('G' or 'Ctrl-G') and
searching ('Ctrl-F'); again, press '?' when asked for input.

If you don't like the standard keyset (either because some keys do not work
properly, or because you want to decrease the amount of typing necessary), you
can use keymaps and macros. See macros_guide.txt in the docs/ directory, or read
it from the in-game help menu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.                          EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you kill monsters, you gain experience points (XP). You receive less XP
when friendly creatures took part in killing the monster. When you get enough
XP, you gain an experience level, making your character more powerful. As they
gain levels, characters gain more hit points, magic points, and spell levels.
Whenever you are curious about the total amount of experience accumulated so
far, or how much experience is needed to advance to the next level, press 'E' or
'%'.

Additionally, the experience you gain goes into your Experience Pool. The pool
is capped at 20000 points. This pool of points is used up whenever you practise
a skill. These skills represent proficiency with all areas of endeavour an
ambitious adventurer might need in the dungeons. They range from different
weapon skills (both for close and ranged combat) to many magical skills and
several additional activities like Dodging or Stabbing. See Appendix
3. List  of Skills for a detailed description of all skills present in Crawl.
The ease with which a character learns a skill depends solely on species. These
aptitudes are hinted at in the list of species (see Appendix
1. List of Character Species). For the curious, the full table can be checked
in aptitudes.txt (also from the help screen during play), though it is not
necessary to bother with the numbers in order to win!

You can see your character's skills by pressing the 'm' key; the higher the
level of a skill, the better you are at it. Almost all characters start with a
few skills already trained (which depends essentially on their background),
those which are not present have to be learned from scratch. Each skill can go
up to 27.

Each time your character gains experience points, those points become available
to increase skills. You convert experience points into skill levels by
practising the skill in question (e.g. fighting with a certain type of weapon,
casting a certain type of spell, or walking around unnoticed to practise
stealth). The amount of unassigned experience points is shown on the main screen
as well as on the skills screen, and the number in blue next to each skill
counts up from 0% to 100% as you get closer to gaining a level in that skill.

You can elect not to practise a particular skill by selecting it in the skill
screen (making it turn dark grey). This means that you will be less likely to
increase that skill when you practise it (and will also not spend as many
experience points on it). The main use of turning off skills is to spend more
points on other skills: You will not lose any experience by deselecting
skills: you will rather spend it elsewhere. It can happen that the pool grows
rather large in this way; there is no effective maximum.

Additionally, pressing # in the skill menu will allow you to toggle automatic
training of skills you already have. If you are automatically training skills,
incoming experience is automatically used to practise these skills in roughly
equal amounts; any experience already in the skill pool when automatic training
is enabled will also be consumed. Since this precludes using experience to train
new skills, of course, you'll want to disable automatic training if you intend
to gain a new skill.

Occasionally you may find a manual of a skill which allows to make quick
progress in this area. Whenever you read it, all your free experience is
transferred into exercising this particular skill. This can be done till
the manual crumbles, which will occur after a random number of uses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.                                MONSTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the caverns of Crawl, you will find a great variety of creatures, most of
which are displayed by capital or small letters of the alphabet. Many of them
would very much like to eat you. To stop them from doing this, you will
generally need to fight them. To attack a monster, stand next to it and move in
its direction; this makes you attack it with your wielded weapon. Of course,
some monsters are just too nasty to beat, and you will find that discretion is
often the better part of valour. Sneaky characters are known to choose
encounters to their liking.

There are several other less dangerous methods you can use to kill monsters.
Hunters and similarly oriented characters will prefer ranged combat to mindless
bashing. When wielding some launcher, the 'f' and 'F' commands will fire
appropriate missiles. See the section on Targeting in the Items Chapter for more
on this. Likewise, many magicians will prefer to use spells from a safe
distance. They can use the 'z' command to cast spells previously memorised.
Again, see the Targeting section.

Some monsters can be friendly; friendly monsters will follow you around and
fight on your behalf (but they gain some of the normal experience points for any
kills they make, so you get less). You can command your allies using the 't' key,
which lets you shout to attract them or tell them who to attack, or else tell
them to stay where they are or to follow you again. You can also shout to get the
attention of all monsters in range if, for some reason, you want to do that. Your
allied monsters may or may not pick up items from the ground - you can set their
behaviour with the 'Ctrl-T' command.

Some special monsters are Uniques. You can identify a unique because he or she
will have a name and personality. Many of these come up with very nasty ideas
how to rid the dungeon of you. Treat them very carefully, particularly if you
meet one of them for the first time.

Other, even rarer, obstacles are statues. A variety of statues can appear,
ranging from harmless granite ones (who still often signify something of
interest) to really dreadful ones. Be alert whenever seeing such a statue. The
best method to destroy most statues is by using wands of disintegration; you can
also bash some of them into pieces by brute force, however.

When playing Crawl, you will undoubtedly want to develop a feeling for the
different monster types. For example, some monsters leave edible corpses, others
don't, and still others do so sometimes. Likewise, ranged or magic attackers
will prove a different kind of threat from melee fighters. Learn from past
deaths and remember which monsters pose the most problems. If particular
monsters are giving you trouble, try to alter your tactics for future
encounters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.                                  ITEMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the dungeons of Crawl there are many different kinds of normal and magical
artefacts to be found and used. Some of them are useful, some are nasty, and
some give great power, but at a price. Some items are unique; these have
interesting properties which can make your life rather bizarre for a while. They
all fall into several classes of items, each of which is used in a different
way. Here is a general list of what you might find in the course of your
adventures, how these are displayed, and what commands there are to use them:

=======  =============  ================================================
)        weapons        (use 'w'ield)
(        missiles       (use 'f'ire)
[        armour         (use 'W'ear and 'T'ake off)
%        food           (use 'e'at; also 'c'hop up corpses)
?        scrolls        (use 'r'ead)
!        potions        (use 'q'uaff)
/        wands          (use 'V' to evoke)
=        rings          (use 'P'ut on and 'R'emove)
"        amulets        (use 'P'ut on and 'R'emove)
\ or |   staves, rods   (use 'w'ield for staves; 'v' for evoking rods)
+ or :   spellbooks     (use 'r'ead and 'M'emorise and 'z'ap)
}        miscellaneous  (use generally 'w'ield and 'v' for evoking)
$        gold           (picking it up takes no turns)
=======  =============  ================================================

There are several general keys for item management:

d
  drop item; if you want to drop only some items from a stack (of arrows,
  for example), then press 'd' followed by a number and then the item's
  slot key

g
  pick up item from the ground (also with the comma key ',') for several items
  press 'g' or ',' twice to get a pickup menu

=
  reassign item slot (works also for spell slots and abilities)

i
  shows inventory - pressing the key of an item shows additional information

{
  inscribe item (see Appendix 6. Inscriptions)

\
  check list of already discovered items

Item usage
========================================

You pick up items with the 'g'et or ',' (comma) command, and drop them with the
'd'rop command. When you are given a prompt like "drop which item?", if you type
a number before the letter of the item, you will drop that quantity of the item
(similarly when picking up). The same works if you want to pick up only part of
a stack and there are several types of items on the square (so that they are
shown in a list). When there is only a single stack of arrows and you want to
pick up only some of them, use the ';' command. Note that picking up items from
one square takes exactly one turn. However, dropping several items at once takes
more turns.

Typing 'i' displays your inventory (what you are carrying). When you are given a
prompt like "Throw [or Wield, Wear, etc] which item?", you usually get a list of
all available options (this behaviour can be changed with the auto_list option).
You can press '*' in case you want to wield something unusual. When the
inventory screen shows "-more-", to show you that there is another page of
items, you can type the letter of the item you want, even if it is not visible,
instead of pressing Space or Enter to see the next page.

You can carry at most 52 items at once, and your total weight is limited by your
carrying capacity. Both of these are printed at the top of the inventory screen.

You can use the adjust command (the '=' key) to change the letters to which your
possessions are assigned. This command can be used to change spell or ability
letters, too.

Some items can be sticky-cursed, in which case they weld themselves to your body
when you use them. Such items usually carry some kind of disadvantage: a weapon
or armour may be damaged or negatively enchanted, while rings can have all
manner of unpleasant effects on you. If you are lucky, you might find magic
which can rid you of these curses.

Items like scrolls, potions, and some other types each have a characteristic,
like a label or a colour, which will let you tell them apart on the basis of
their function. However, these characteristics change between each game, so
while in one game every potion of healing may be yellow, in another game they
might all be purple and bubbly. Once you have discovered the function of such an
item, you will remember it for the rest of the current game. You can access your
item discoveries with the '\' key.

In order to get a description of what an item does, bring up the inventory (with
'i') and press the letter of that item. Try this when comparing different types
of armours and weapons, but don't expect too much information from examining
unidentified items.

Another useful command is the '{' key, which lets you inscribe items with a
comment. This is often used to denote special properties of an item, making for
easier navigation of large quantities of artefacts. You can also inscribe items
when looking at your inventory with 'i', simply by pressing the letter of an
item. For more details, and how to automatise this process, check Appendix 6.
Inscriptions.

) Weapons
========================================

These are rather important. You will find a variety of weapons in the dungeon,
ranging from small and quick daggers to huge, cumbersome battleaxes and
polearms. Each type of weapon does a different amount of damage, has a different
chance of hitting its target, and takes a different amount of time to swing.
There are several weapon skills (press 'm' to show a list of those that you are
training) like Short Blades, Long Blades, Axes, etc. These skills affect damage,
accuracy, and speed. (The same goes for Unarmed Combat.)

Weapons can be enchanted; when they are identified, they have values which tell
you how much more effective they are than an unenchanted version. The first
number is the enchantment to-hit, which affects the weapon's accuracy, and the
second is its damage enchantment; weapons which are not enchanted are simply
'+0'. Some weapons also have special magical effects which make them very
effective in certain situations. Some types of hand weapons (especially daggers,
spears and hand axes) are quite effective when thrown.

You can wield weapons with the 'w' command, which is a very quick action. If for
some reason you want to go bare-handed, type 'w' followed by a hyphen ('-').
Note that weapons are not the only class of item which is useful to wield.

The ' (apostrophe) key is a shortcut which automatically wields the item in slot
a. If item a is being wielded, ' causes you to wield item b instead, if
possible. Try assigning the letter a to your primary weapon, and b to your bow
or something else you need to wield only sometimes. Note that this is just a
typing shortcut and is not functionally different to wielding these items
normally.

You can press '}' to show your primary (wielded) and secondary (slot b) weapons,
as well as the preferred missiles (to be shot when using 'f' to fire).

( Missiles
========================================

If you would rather pick off monsters from a safe distance, you will need
missiles for your sling, bow or other appropriate launcher. Several kinds of
missiles, such as javelins, are effective when simply thrown; other kinds
require you to wield an appropriate device to inflict worthwhile damage.
Missiles have only one "plus" value, which affects both accuracy and damage.
Upon impact, missiles may become destroyed. The chance for this to occur depends
on the type of missile. A higher "plus" value also helps.

The 'f' command fires or throws a missile, typically chosen from lots suitable
for your weapon. The default lot (your "quiver") is displayed on the main screen
beneath your wielded weapon. The quivered item will always be what Crawl thinks
is most likely to be what you want. Thus it will either be an item you
previously chose and fired (with 'f') or directly quivered (with 'Q'), or the
item in your inventory that ranks highest in fire_order - if there are several
of similar order, the one with the lowest inventory slot is chosen.

See Appendix 6. Inscriptions for inscriptions which let you fine-tune the
list of items to choose from. See also the Missiles section of
options_guide.txt.

The firing interface also allows you to manually select an item to throw with
'i'; but it may not be very effective if you lack the correct launcher. At times
it is sensible to throw weapons like daggers, clubs, spears or hand axes.

Use the '(', ')' to cycle through your quiver without firing, and 'Q' to choose
the quivered item from a list. If you would like to throw something without
inserting it into the quiver use 'F' instead. Note that non-weapon, non-missile
items will never be quivered.

The interface for shooting or throwing things is also used for evoking wands and
casting certain spells, and is described in detail in section I (Targeting).

[ Armour
========================================

This is also rather important. Most worn armour improves your Armour Class,
which decreases the amount of damage you take when something injures you. The
heavier an armour is, the more AC (armour class) it will provide, at the
expensive of your EV (evasion) and stealth. Heavier types of armour also
hamper your melee speed, making it harder for you to hit monsters. These effects
can be mitigated by a high Armour skill. Wearing heavy armour also increases
your chances of miscasting spells, an effect which is only slightly reduced by
your Armour skill. On the other hand, body armour will also provide some
guaranteed damage reduction, and very heavy armours are distinguishedly better
at this.

A Shield normally affects neither your AC or your evasion, but it lets you block
some of the attacks aimed at you and absorbs some of the damage you would
otherwise receive from things like dragon breath and lightning bolts. Wearing a
shield (especially a large shield) makes you less effective in hand combat and
hampers your ability to cast spells. Shields are more effective when you're
fighting a small number of foes than when you're surrounded. There are three
types: bucklers, shields, and large shields. While it is possible to use bows or
other launchers and rods while wearing a shield, you'll be less effective at
doing so.

Some magical armours have special powers. These powers are sometimes automatic,
affecting you whenever you wear the armour, and sometimes must be activated with
the 'a' command.

You can wear armour with the 'W' command, and take it off with the 'T' command.
With '[' you can have a quick look at your current gear.

Most armours can be improved by reading the appropriate scroll. Body
armour and bardings can be enchanted up to the base value of AC they
provide. Shields can be enchanted up to +3. Other gear is limited to +2.

% Food and Carrion
========================================

Food is extremely important. You can find many different kinds of food in the
dungeon. If you don't eat when you get hungry, you will eventually die of
starvation. Fighting, carrying heavy loads, casting spells, and using some
magical items will make you hungry. When you are starving, you fight less
effectively as well. You can eat food with the 'e' command.

You may wish to dine on the corpses of your casualties (unless you are a
Spriggan, and cannot eat meat, or you are a Mummy, who need not, and cannot, eat
at all). Despite the fact that corpses are represented by the same '%' sign as
food, you can't eat them without first cutting off the more edible pieces with
the 'c' command. Being hungry helps you choke down the raw flesh. Even then,
you should choose your homemade food with great care. In order to chop up a
corpse with the 'c' command, you need to have a proper tool (like a knife or
short sword), although claws will also do. Cutting off the best parts will take
some turns and produce a number of 'chunks' eventually. These can be eaten with
'e' command as above. Your character will automatically switch to an uncursed
butchering tool when you type 'c', and will also switch back to your previous
weapon unless you get interrupted while butchering your food.

Some species are less fastidious about their food. Trolls and Ghouls can use
their claws, and so do not need a cutting device. Also, Orcs, Ogres, Kobolds,
Trolls and Ghouls care less (in different degrees) about the quality of the
corpse. Kobolds, Trolls and Ghouls are happy to eat raw meat at any time.

Vampires are a special case. Members of this species can try to drink blood from
a fresh corpse (use the 'e' command). Once they have reached experience level 6,
they can also bottle potions of blood from corpses. This is done using the
'a'bilities menu.

? Magical Scrolls
========================================

Scrolls have many different magical spells inscribed on them, some good and some
bad. One of the most useful scrolls is the scroll of identify, which will tell
you the function of any item you have in your inventory; save these up for the
more powerful and inscrutable magic items, such as rings. You can read scrolls
(and by doing so invoke their magic) with the 'r' command.

! Magical Potions
========================================

While scrolls tend to affect your equipment or your environment, most potions
affect your character in some way. The most common type is the simple healing
potion, which restores some hit points and cures many ailments, but there are
many other varieties of potions to be found. Potions can be quaffed (drunk) with
the 'q' command. Try to avoid drinking poisonous potions! By the way, you can
also drink from the fountains you encounter in the dungeon.

/ Wands
========================================

Sometimes you will be lucky enough to find a stick which contains stored magical
energies. Wands each have a certain amount of charges, and a wand will cease to
function when its charges run out. You must identify a wand to find out how many
uses it has left. This can be done with a scroll of identify; characters with a
good Evocations skill may also deduce the number of charges simply upon evoking
the wand. Wands are aimed in the same way as missile weapons, and you can
release the power of a wand by evoking it with 'V'. See section I for targeting.
There are also a number of wands that may be useful to aim at yourself, but it
is usually prudent to know what you are evoking before you do so.

=" Rings and Amulets
========================================

Magical rings are among the most useful of the items you will find in the
dungeon, but can also be some of the most hazardous. They transfer various
magical abilities onto their wearer, but powerful rings like rings of
regeneration or invisibility make you hunger very quickly when they are
activated. Use the 'P' command to put on rings, and 'R' to remove them. You can
wear up to two rings simultaneously, one on each hand; which hand you put a ring
on is immaterial to its function. If you try to put on a ring while both ring
fingers are full, you will be asked which one to remove. Some rings function
automatically, while others require activation (the 'a' command).

Amulets are similar to rings, but have a different range of effects (which tend
to be more subtle). Amulets are worn around the neck, and you can wear only one
at a time.

You can press '"' to quickly check what jewellery you're wearing.

| Staves
========================================

There are a number of types of magical staves. Some enhance your general
spellcasting ability, while some greatly increase the power of a certain class
of spells (and possibly reduce your effectiveness with others). They can even be
used in hand-to-hand combat about as effectively as quarterstaves.

Spell staves (called "rods" in the game) are a totally different kind of item.
They hold spells which you can cast without having to memorise them first. You
must wield a rod like a weapon in order to gain from its power. Rods can be
invoked with the 'v' command when wielded. They have a pool of magical energy
which regenerates according to the rod's enchantment (which can be increased
using scrolls of recharging) and your Evocations skill. It also bears mentioning
that rods recharge their energies from the available MP of the person who
wields
them. They're shorter than full-length staves and thus use the Maces & Flails
skill instead of Staves when used as a cudgel.

+ Books
========================================

(Depending on your settings, books may also be shown as : symbols.)

Most books contain magical spells which your character may be able to learn. You
can read a book with the 'r' command, which lets you access a description of
each spell, or memorise spells from it with the 'M' command. Use 'z' to cast
previously memorised spells. For spells demanding a target, the comments on
using missile weapons apply. Many spells have a limited range and casting will
be aborted if there are no potential targets within this range. If this case,
neither magic nor time are expended. If, for whatever reason, you want to cast
the spell nonetheless, you can use the 'Z' command.

As important as it is to pick up new spells it may be to get rid of old ones.
Apart from divine help, the most convenient way to do so is by reading a scroll
of amnesia, which will let you pick a scroll to forget. However, should you
happen to have a shortage of such scrolls, you can also forget a spell by
tearing out the relevant pages of a book. Unfortunately, this violent procedure
will inevitably consume the whole book. You can undertake this by 'r'eading a
book, then selecting a spell you already have learnt, and 'F'orget it.

You can also press 'I' to just have a look at all spells memorised. From this
screen, you can read the descriptions of the spells and check various details
about your casting abilities. Note that '=' allows you to change what spells are
assigned to what keys.

Some books have other special effects, and powerful spellbooks have been known
to resent the attentions of incompetent magicians.

Occasionally you will find manuals of some skill. Reading these will cause your
free experience to go straight into that skill.

{ Miscellaneous
========================================

These are items which don't fall into any other category. They can be evoked
with 'V', just like wands. Runes, a particular item in this category, have no
function whatsoever except to open the endgame. You must collect at least
three in order to enter the Realm of Zot. Some particularly cocky adventurers
brag about having retrieved ten or even twenty runes through their strength
and cunning, but most scholars on the subject of Zot agree that such a thing
is probably impossible in the first place, and secondly would be a meaningless
achievement in any regard.

$ Gold
========================================

Gold can be used to buy items should you run across shops. (Shops do not buy, by
the way.) There are also a few more esoteric uses for gold. Gold coins do not
have any weight in Crawl, and picking up some coins does not take a turn.

Whenever you pick up gold, your total wealth is shown as well. Should you want
to have a glance at your finances at some other opportunity, pressing '$' (or
'%') allows you to do so.

Racial Items
========================================

Some items have been crafted by members of a gifted species, and have special
properties.

Dwarven weapons and armours are very durable, and do not rust or corrode easily.
All species get a bonus when wearing Dwarven armours at the expense that these
mails make spellcasting slightly more difficult. Dwarves get a larger bonus
without the magical hampering.

In general, Orcs do better with gear from their own kin; this applies to weapons,
as well as to armours.

Elven body armour does not hamper spellcasting as much as other armours of the
same type would. Elven cloaks and boots are particularly useful to those who
wish to be stealthy. An Elf does a bit better when wearing armour or weapons of
his own kind.

Centaurs and Nagas have uniquely shaped bodies. With luck, however, a character
of these species might find a Centaur or Naga barding.

Artefacts
========================================

Weapons, armour, jewellery and spellbooks can be artefacts. These come in two
flavours: randomly created artefacts ('randarts') and predefined ones
('unrandarts'). Artefacts will always carry unusual names, such as "golden
sword" or "shimmering scale mail". Also, artefacts cannot be modified in any
way, including enchantments.

Apart from that, otherwise mundane items can get one special property. These are
called 'ego items', and examples are: boots of running, a weapon of flaming, a
helmet of see invisible, and so on. Note that such items can be modified, and
thus are subject to corrosion and enchanting scrolls.

All ego items are noted with special adjectives but not all items noted in this
way need have a special property (they often have some positive or negative
enchantment, though):

:general: glowing, runed;
:metal armours: shiny;
:leather armours, animal skins: dyed;
:other armours: embroidered.

Normal and ego helmets can both have extra decorations ("winged",
"plumed", etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.                              SPELLCASTING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magical spells are a very important part of surviving in the dungeon. Every
character can make use of magical spells, although those who enter the dungeon
without magical skills must practise by reading scrolls before they can attempt
spellcasting.

There are many skills related to magic, the principal one being Spellcasting.
Spellcasting determines the number of Magic Points available; it also helps in
several respects during the actual casting of spells. Next, there are several
general magical skill areas (Conjuration, Enchantment, Summoning, Necromancy,
Translocation and Transmutation) as well as several elemental areas (Fire, Ice,
Air and Earth) and, finally, Poison. A particular spell can belong to (and thus
train) up to three areas. Being good in the areas of a spell will improve the
casting chance and, in many cases, the effect as well.

Spells are stored in books, which you will occasionally find in the dungeon. You
can read books with 'r' to check what spells they contain; doing so will allow
you to read the individual spells' descriptions. In order to try to memorise a
certain spell, use the 'M' command. Memorising can take a while and, for
high-level spells, be hazardous.

Each spell has a level. A spell's level denotes the amount of skill required to
use it and indicates how powerful it may be. You can only memorise a certain
number of levels of spells; type 'M' to find out how many. When you gain
experience levels or advance the Spellcasting skill, your maximum increases; you
will need to save up for several levels to memorise the more powerful spells.
When casting a spell, you temporarily expend some of your magical energy and
become hungrier (although high intelligence and Spellcasting help against hunger
from spells). Pressing 'II' (or 'I!') displays the hunger costs of your spells
in terms of food, on a scale of none, sultana, strawberry, choko, honeycomb and
ration. Casting the spell five times will cost at most the displayed food item.

You activate a memorised spell by pressing 'z' (for Zap). Use 'I' to display a
list of all memorised spells without actually casting one. The spells available
are labelled with letters; you are free to change this labelling with the '='
command. You can assign both lowercase and uppercase letters to spells. Some
spells, for example most damage dealing ones, require a target. See the next
section for details on how to target.

Most spells have caps on their effects: no matter how intelligent and proficient
you are, there is a limit to the damage you can achieve with a Magic Dart. In
generally, it is a good idea to look at the output of the 'I' and 'II' screens
to get a picture on your casting abilities. This is especially useful if you're
about to change armour or rings.

High level spells are difficult to cast, and you may miscast them every once in
a while (resulting in a waste of magic and possibly dangerous side-effects).
Your chance of failing to cast a spell properly depends on your skills, your
intelligence, the level of the spell and whether you are wearing heavy armour.
Failing to cast a spell exercises your spell skills, but not by as much as
casting it successfully.

Many of the more powerful spells carry disadvantages or risks; you should read
the spell description (obtained by reading the spellbook in which you found the
spell) before casting anything.

There is a completely different way to the use spells: via rods. These are
magical staves holding a number of spells. Rods store a certain number of magic
points, which are used for powering the spells they contain; when not fully
charged, they regenerate magic points from their owner's pool (this happens much
more quickly if the rod is wielded). You can spend scrolls of recharging on rods
in order to increase the maximal size of their magical reservoir. The
effectiveness of your rod's spells is governed by your Evocations skill.

Be careful of magic-using enemies! Some of them can use magic just as well as
you, if not better, and often use it intelligently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.                                TARGETING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When throwing something, evoking certain wands, or casting spells, you
are asked for a direction. There are several ways to tell Crawl which
monster to target. (The following list assumes the option setting
default_target = true which is default.)

You can press '?' when asked for a direction; this will bring up a help
screen. Else, you use the following commands:

  - The cursor will target on the monster which is closest to your position.
    Should you have been firing at something previously, with the offender
    still being in sight, the cursor will instead rest on the previous target.
  - Pressing '+' or '=' moves the cursor to the next monster, going from nearer
    to further away. Similarly, '-' cycles backwards.
  - Any direction key moves the cursor by one square. Occasionally, it can be
    useful to target non-inhabited squares.
  - When you are content with your choice of target, press one key of Enter,
    Del, or Space to fire at the target. If you press '.', you also fire, but
    the spell/missile will stop at the target's square if it misses. This can
    be useful to keep friendlies out of the fire, or to make sure your precious
    missiles won't end up in deep water.
  - You can press Escape if you changed your mind - no turns are deducted.

There are some shortcuts while targeting:

  - Typing Shift-direction on your keypad fires straight away in that direction.
  - Pressing 'p' or 'f' fires at the previous target (if it is still alive and
    in sight). Due to this, most hunters can go a long way by pressing 'ff' to
    fire their ammunition at a monster and then keep firing at it with further
    'ff' strokes. At times, it will be useful to switch targets with the '+' or
    '-' commands, though.

It is possible to target yourself: obviously beneficial effects like hasting or
healing will actually target the cursor on you, leaving to you only the pressing
of '.', Enter, etc. - except if you want to heal or haste someone else. If you
target yourself while firing something harmful (which can be sensible at times),
you will be asked for confirmation.

Finally, there are some more targeting related commands:

  - '(' and ')' allow to change the ammunition. This is useful when you have
    several types of appropriate ammunition, say poisoned needles and curare
    needles. Your last usage will be remembered. Note that you can use '(' for
    changing the quiver ammunition even outside of targeting.
  - The ':' key allows you to hide the path of your spell/wand/missile.
  - Ctrl-F changes which monsters are cycled when using '+', '=' or '-':
    hostiles, friends, plants or all monsters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
J.                                RELIGION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of gods, demons and other assorted powers who will accept
your character's worship, and sometimes give out favours in exchange. You can
use the '^' command to check the requirements of whoever it is that you worship,
and if you find religion to be an inconvenience you can always renounce your
faith (use the 'a' command - but most gods resent being scorned). For most gods,
there is a second page with additional details, press '^!' to access it.

The 'p' command lets you pray to your god, in order to sacrifice items. For
example, blood gods will want you to offer corpses to them by pressing 'p' over
the corpse(s). Praying also gives you a sense of what your god thinks of you.
Some gods have a special conduct at their altars; if so, this is explained in
the '^' and '^!' screens.

To use any powers which your god deems you fit for, access the abilities menu
via the 'a' command; god-given abilities are listed as invocations.

Depending on background, some characters start out religious; others have to
pray at an altar to dedicate themselves to a life of servitude. There are altars
scattered all over the dungeon, and your character has heard rumours of a
special temple somewhere near the surface. At an altar, you can read a
description of that god's general attitude by pressing 'p'. You will be asked
afterward if you really want to attend this circle. If you want to see a list
of the standard gods and which of them is already present with an altar in
your dungeon, press 'Ctrl-O'. You can also learn about standard and obscure
gods by pressing '?/G'.

Note that the good gods will not accept demonic or undead devotees.

If you like to start the game with a religion, choose your background from
Healer, Priest, Berserker, Chaos Knight, Abyssal Knight or Death Knight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
K.                                MUTATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although it would doubtless be a nice thing if you could remain genetically
pure, there are too many toxic wastes and mutagenic radiations in the Dungeon
for that to be possible. If your character is so affected by these that he or
she undergoes physiological change, you can use the 'A' command to see how much
of a freak they've become and the 'a' command to activate any mutations which
can be controlled. Many mutations are actually beneficial to the characters, but
there are plenty of nasty ones as well. Many mutations have three levels, each
of which counts as a single mutation. Some changes to the primary attributes
Strength, Intelligence and Dexterity (apart from those by leveling) are also
handled as mutations - in particular, these are not permanent.

You can also become mutated by overusing certain powerful enchantments,
particularly Haste (not the kind you get from being berserk) and Invisibility,
as your system absorbs too much magical energy - but you would have to spend
quite a lot of your time hasted or invisible to be affected. However, some
powerful items also radiate dangerous levels of magical energy. More often than
not, the mutations caused by magical radiations express harmfully.

Furthermore, certain corpses are mutagenic, and there are traps with mutation
effects. There are also some spells and potions that cause mutations.

It is much more difficult to get rid of bad mutations than to get one. A lucky
mutation attempt can actually remove mutations. However, the only sure-fire way
is to quaff a potion of cure mutation, which will attempt to remove one or more
random mutations.

A special case are Demonspawn. Characters of this species get certain special
powers during their career; these are listed in red. They are permanent and can
never be removed. If one of your Demonspawn powers has been augmented by a
mutation, it is displayed in a lighter red colour.

Many a species starts with some special intrinsic feats, like the greater speed
of Centaurs or Spriggans, or the eating habits of Trolls, Kobolds and others.
These are often, but not always, like a preset mutation. In case such an innate
feature gets amplified by an ordinary mutation, it is displayed in a light blue
colour.

The history of Crawl is somewhat convoluted: Crawl was created in 1995 by Linley
Henzell. Linley based Crawl loosely on Angband and NetHack, but avoided several
annoying aspects of these games, and added a lot of original ideas of his own.
Crawl was a hit, and Linley produced Crawl versions up to 3.30 in March 1999.
Further work was then carried out by a group of developers who released 3.40 in
February 2000. Of them, Brent Ross emerged as the single maintainer, producing
versions until 4.0 beta 26 in 2002. After a long period of silent work, he went
a great step by releasing 4.1.2 alpha in August 2005. This alpha contained a lot
of good ideas, but was nearly unplayable due to balance issues. In the meantime,
several patchers appeared, improving Crawl's interface tremendously. Several of
them formed a new devteam; reasoning that rebalancing 4.1.2 was a very difficult
task, they decided to fork Crawl 4.0 beta 26 and selectively include good ideas
from 4.1.2 and other sources, resulting in the Stone Soup fork. Stone Soup's 
release versions were restarted at 0.1 to avoid confusion with the existing 
plethora of Crawl versions. The game you are playing now, Crawl Light, is
a fork of the eighth major version of Stone Soup, version 0.8.

It should be mentioned that there have been other Crawl variants over the years,
among them Ax-Crawl, Tile Crawl, Dungeon Crawl Alternative.

The object of your quest in Crawl (the Orb of Zot) was taken from Wizard's
Castle, a text adventure written in BASIC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.                      MACROS, OPTIONS, PERFORMANCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crawl supports redefining keys via key maps. This is useful when your keyboard
layout makes some key awkward to use. You can also define macros: these are
command sequences which can make playing a great deal more convenient. Note that
mapping 'a' to some other key will treat almost all pressings of 'a' in that new
way (including dropping and wielding, etc.), so is not recommended. Macroing 'a'
to some other key will only change the command key 'a'.

You can set up key maps and macros in-game with the '~' key ('Ctrl-D' will also
work); this also allows for saving all current key bindings and macros.
Alternatively, you can directly edit the macro.txt file. For more information on
both and for examples, see macros_guide.txt.

Crawl supports a large number of options that allow for great flexibility in the
interface. They are fully documented in the file options_guide.txt. The options
themselves are set in the file ~/.crawlrc (for UNIX systems - copy over init.txt
to ~/.crawlrc) or init.txt (for Windows).

Several interface routines are outsourced to external Lua scripts. The standard
distribution has them in the dat/lua/ directory. Have a look at the single
scripts for short descriptions.

Generally, Crawl should run swiftly on all machines (it compiles out of the box
for Linux, Windows, OS X and, to some lesser extent, DOS and Unix). If, for some
reason, you find Crawl runs unacceptably slowly on your machine, there are a few
measures which may improve the situation:

  - avoid greedy autoexplore
  - set travel_delay = -1 to avoid screen redraws during travel (this might be
    useful if playing on a remote server)

N.                         PHILOSOPHY (PAS DE FAQ)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As this fork was created largely to address problems inherent not only in the
content of Stone Soup but in the very development philosophy leading to said
content, it will perhaps be most useful to address the ways in which this game
is meant to differ from Stone Soup. The philosophy of the Stone Soup DevTeam can
be found in the Stone Soup manual; it is not repeated in full here.

While many of the aims of the Stone Soup team, such as the avoidance of grinding
and the desire for a painless interface, are not only admirable but have been 
executed well, many of their other aims have done and continue to do serious 
harm to the enjoyability of the game. Some of them are addressed below.

Balance
========================================

What it means for a game to be balanced is, as noted by the Stone Soup team,
nebulous at best. Unfortunately, the concept of balance as presented in the
Stone Soup manual, that skill should be the primary factor in success, only
nominally helps, since this definition seems to be frequently ignored. That the
definition itself does not work well with the current design of Stone Soup only
compounds matters.

For the purposes of this discussion, it will be useful to consider two different
types of difficulty that games can impose upon its players: they will be
referred to here as "enforced difficulty" and "permitted difficulty". Enforced
difficulty arises when a game presents a barrier that every player will need to
overcome in order to attain victory; unique monsters are an example of this, as
they are usually challenging foes who must invariably be vanquished or avoided
in order to win. When a game recognises the achievements of a skilled player who
goes out of his or her way to do something that is particularly difficult but
strictly optional, this is permitted difficulty. In NetHack, for example,
permitted difficulty comes from the tracking of player conducts.

Currently, what permitted difficulty Stone Soup has is concentrated in one
place: the so-called extended endgame, a series of optional dungeon branches
meant to allow expert players to use their skills for particularly impressive
wins. The current design of the dungeon and of the game does not allow for much
permitted difficulty prior to this; as a result, designing the game to be
enjoyable by its most experienced players, allowing their skill at the game to
matter, requires steadily increasing the game's enforced difficulty. The DevTeam
has shown little reluctance to do this, to the detriment of accessibility to
newcomers.

The nominal definition of balance, as seen in the Stone Soup manual's Philosophy
section, conspicuously makes no argument toward the necessity of each race or
each background being equally easy to play, and indeed, members of the Stone
Soup DevTeam have said as much. They certainly have not acted as though this is
the case, however; as just one of many counterexamples, the principal motivation
for the Berserker nerf in the forthcoming 0.9 version of Stone Soup is that the
background was seen as particularly easy to win in Stone Soup 0.8.

Therefore, the Stone Soup notion of balance is fractured and broken, and so
Crawl Light discards it in favor of a new one: the game will be adequately
balanced when both beginners and experts can play the same game and have a good
deal of fun doing so. Beginners should, particularly early on, need to contend
with less enforced difficulty than is currently present in Stone Soup (which
is not to say that it shouldn't exist; a game lacking in difficulty is itself no
fun!), while experts should be able to seek permitted difficulty much sooner
than they currently can. Guiding the development of this first version of Crawl
Light is the notion that the former problem is somewhat more pressing; the
latter will be seriously addressed in a later version.

Stone Soup and "no-brainers"
========================================

To borrow a quote from the Stone Soup manual's Philosophy section: "Speaking
about games in general, whenever there's a no-brainer, that means the
development team put a lot of effort into providing a 'choice' that's really
not an interesting choice at all." This is proof that even highly attractive
statements can be deeply wrong.

If an ability available to the player is so weak that it's a "no-brainer" to
never use it, this is indeed a problem; the appropriate action would be to
either improve the ability to make it usably good or to remove it outright.
However, the same does not necessarily hold true for abilities that are so
powerful as to be desired by most or even all players. In any system with a rich
variety of skills, some are simply going to be valuable in a wider array of
circumstances than others. This is not, in itself, a problem, even if an ability
is good enough to be useful to all players; this just makes it a staple skill. 
A good example of this is Haste: in a game as hard as Crawl, an ability that
gives the player more turns than they would otherwise get will always be useful,
but the game is not weaker for its presence.

When these "no-brainer" abilities become a problem is when it becomes rare to
use anything else. Here, the problem is not necessarily of inherent
overpoweredness but of mutual exclusion. If two skills are competing for a
resource, whether it be MP, piety, experience investment, or simply turns, and
one skill always or almost always loses, there is a problem. It might be that
one of the skills is overpowered; there again, the other one might be
underpowered.

That the Crawl DevTeam persists in believing in this "no-brainer" philosophy and
acting on it is itself bad enough, but the way in which they have done so ranges
from comedic to downright depressing. Whenever something the player can do is
perceived as such a "no-brainer", its alternatives, whatever they are, are never
buffed to match; the ability itself has always been nerfed. As a result, a
game with a level of enforced difficulty that is already too high will simply
get harder as time goes by. Therefore, Crawl Light rejects this aspect of the
Stone Soup development philosophy too.

Options
========================================

Much of the enjoyment to be found in playing a game like Crawl comes from
creative application of the available options to vanquish monsters and escape
nasty situations. Player setups designed explicitly to remove such tactical
richness from the player's grasp in return for straightforward power, therefore,
represent bad design and should be avoided. Demigods in Stone Soup (but removed
from Crawl Light) are a prime example of this, sacrificing the interesting
abilities afforded by god worship in return for, simply, higher attributes. It
doesn't matter whether this makes the race easier or harder to win than average;
the important thing is that this makes the race more boring. Note that spriggans
aren't an example of a bad selection; while they lose some capabilities had by
other races, who can wear more armor and have fewer food worries, they make up
for it by having their own unique, interesting tactical capabilities. Having bad
choices of race and class available is worse than simply removing them outright;
such unnecessary options in the player creation menu can be downright paralysing
to newcomers.

Death out of nowhere
========================================

As Dwarf Fortress is quick to remind us, losing can be fun. But the
circumstances surrounding a loss play an important role in whether it actually
is.

In the original Rogue, the game was quite often simply unwinnable. The dungeon
might not generate enough food for you to survive, or you might need to get past
a particularly vicious monster without having the resources to survive the
encounter. When you lost, and you could expect to lose often, you'd only have
invested an hour or so into your character. Some more recent roguelikes are like
this too: losing in DoomRL or Shiren the Wanderer doesn't sting as much as it
might, because the games are quite short.

Crawl is not a short game. While it isn't as long as Angband by a long shot, it
is still long enough for losing to be a heavy blow. And when a game as long as
this is lost suddenly and without warning, it can leave the player feeling
cheated, as anyone who's ever been sacrificed on an altar in ADOM can probably
attest. While Stone Soup has few instadeaths in the strictest sense of the word,
it does have a number of foes capable of dealing so much damage that an
unsuspecting player may find himself dead without a chance to react. Experienced
or spoiled players will know to react appropriately to them on sight, but the
only way to learn these foes naturally is often to be killed by them. While the
first verison of Crawl Light does not solve this problem, it is, at least,
recognised as one.

1.                        LIST OF CHARACTER SPECIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Use 'A' to check for which particular peculiarities a species might
          have. Also, some species have special abilities which can be accessed
          by the 'a' abilities menu. Some also have physical characteristics
          which allow them to make extra attacks using the Unarmed Combat
          skill.

Humans
  Humans tend to be hardworking and industrious, and learn new things quickly.
  The Human species is the most versatile of all the species available to
  players. Humans advance quickly in levels and have equal abilities in all
  skills.

Hill Orcs
  Hill Orcs are Orcs from the upper world who, jealous of the riches which their
  cousins (the Cave Orcs) possess below the ground, descend in search of plunder
  and adventure.

  Hill Orcs are as robust as the Mountain Dwarves, but have very low reserves of
  magical energy. Their forte is brute-force fighting, and they are skilled at
  using most hand weapons (with the exception of short blades, at which they
  are only fair), though they are not particularly good at using missile
  weapons. They prefer to use their own weapons. Orcs are poor at using most
  types of magic, with the exception of conjurations, summoning, necromancy, and
  the elemental magic of earth, fire and ice. They advance in levels as quickly
  as Humans.

  Many orcs feel superior to all other species and beings, and they have formed
  a religion around that idea. Only Hill Orcs can worship Beogh, the Orc god,
  and Hill Orc Priests may start in Beogh's service.

Merfolk
  The Merfolk are a hybrid species of half-human, half-fish that typically live
  in the oceans and rivers, seldom venturing toward land. However, Merfolk
  aren't as limited on land as some myths suggest; their tails will quickly
  reform into legs once they leave the water (and, likewise, their legs will
  quickly reform into a tail should they ever enter water). Their agility is
  often misjudged, and they tend to be surprisingly nimble on land as well as in
  the water. Experts at swimming, they need not fear drowning, as they can
  quickly slip out of any encumbering armour during the transformation into
  their half-fish form.

  The Merfolk have developed their martial arts strongly on thrusting and
  grappling, since those are the most efficient ways to fight underwater.
  They therefore prefer polearms and short swords above all other weapons,
  though they can also use longer swords quite well.

  As spellcasters, they tend to be quite good in specific areas. Their mystical
  relationship with water makes it easier for them to use poison and ice
  magics, which use water occasionally as a material component. The legendary
  water magic of the Merfolk was lost in ancient times, but some of that
  affinity still remains. The instability of their own morphogenic matrix has
  made them very accomplished transmuters, but most other magics seem foreign to
  them.

Halflings
  Halflings, who are named for being about half the size of Humans, live in
  small villages. They live simple lives and have simple interests. Sometimes
  a particularly restless Halfling will leave his or her village in search of
  adventure.

  Halflings are very small but surprisingly hardy for their size, even
  having an innate resistance to mutagenic effects. Although only average
  at most fighting skills, they can use short blades well and excel in
  ranged combat with slings. They are also very stealthy and dextrous, but
  are poor at magic (except for charms and translocations). They advance in
  levels as rapidly as Humans. Halflings cannot wield large weapons.

Kobolds
  Kobolds are small, ugly creatures with few redeeming features. They are not
  the sort of people you would want to spend much time with, unless you happened
  to be a Kobold yourself.

  They tend to be stronger and less agile than Halflings, and are more
  talented at using most types of magic, particularly summonings and
  necromancy. They are competent in combat, especially with short blades,
  maces, or crossbows, and are also very adept at using magical devices.
  They often live as scavengers, surviving on carrion (which they can eat
  even when not hungry), but are carnivorous and can only eat meat. Kobolds
  advance in levels as quickly as Humans.

Spriggans
  Spriggans are small magical creatures distantly related to Elves. They love to
  frolic and cast mischievous spells.

  They are poor fighters, have little physical resilience and are terrible at
  destructive magic - conjurations, summonings, necromancy and elemental spells.
  On the other hand, they are excellent at other forms of magic, and are very
  good at moving silently and quickly. So great is their speed that a Spriggan
  can overtake a Centaur. Due to their tiny size, they need very little food.
  However, they are herbivorous and cannot eat meat. Their size also makes them
  unable to wear most armour.

Nagas
  Nagas are a hybrid species: Human from the waist up with a large snake tail
  instead of legs.

  They are reasonably good at most things and advance in experience levels at
  the same rate as Sludge Elves. They are naturally immune to poisons, can see
  invisible creatures and have tough skin, but their tails are relatively slow
  and cannot move them around as quickly as can other creatures' legs (this only
  affects their movement rate; all other actions are at normal speed). Their
  body shape also prevents them from gaining full protection from most armour. A
  Naga's biggest forte is stealth: Nagas are very good at moving unnoticed.

  Every now and then, a Naga can spit poison; the range, accuracy and damage of
  this poison increases with the Naga's experience level.

Centaurs
  The Centaurs are another species of hybrid creatures: horses with Human
  torsos. They usually live in forests, surviving by hunting.

  Centaurs can move very quickly on their four legs, and are excellent with bows
  and other missile weapons; they are also reasonable at fighting in general
  while being slow learners at specific weapon skills. They advance quite slowly
  in experience levels and are rather sub-average at using magic. Due to their
  large bulk, they need a little extra food to survive. Like Nagas, they receive
  inferior protection from the armour they wear.

Ogres
  Ogres are huge, chunky creatures who typically are strong rather than smart,
  and not nimble at all. Their size also makes them hunger more than smaller
  folk. Ogres mature almost as quickly as Humans.

  Their preferred methods of avoiding beatings are dodging and the use of
  shields. Many Ogres find it natural to wield some large and blunt weapon.
  (Countless lethal incidents have taught them to leave most edged weapons be.)
  While all sophisticated forms of missile combat are too awkward for them, they
  are good at throwing things, in particular boulders.

  Contrary to expectations, Ogres are not reduced to mindless brutes. They
  possess a raw talent for witchcraft, letting them pick up the basics of
  spellcasting at an amazing speed. However, the more arcane schools of magic
  are foreign to them and are only learned at poor rates.

Trolls
  Trolls are like Ogres, but even nastier. They have thick, knobbly skins of any
  colour from putrid green to mucky brown, which are covered in patches of thick
  fur, and their mouths are full of ichor-dripping fangs.

  They can rip creatures apart with their claws, and regenerate very quickly
  from even the most terrible wounds. They learn very slowly indeed - as slowly
  as High Elves - and need a great amount of food to survive.

Minotaurs
  The Minotaurs are yet another species of hybrids - Human bodies with bovine
  heads. They delve into the Dungeon because of their instinctive love of
  twisting passageways.

  Minotaurs are extremely good at all forms of physical combat, but are awful at
  using any type of magic. They can wear all armour except for some headgear.

Kenku
  The Kenku are an ancient and feared species of bird-people with a legendary
  propensity for violence. Basically humanoid with bird-like heads and clawed
  feet, the Kenku can wear all types of armour except helmets and boots. Despite
  their lack of wings, powerful Kenku can fly, and very powerful members of this
  species can stay in the air for as long as they wish to do so. They fly a bit
  faster if they carry little load.

  They are experts at all forms of fighting, including the magical arts of
  combat (conjurations, summonings and, to a lesser extent, necromancy). They
  are good at air and fire elemental magic, but poor at ice and earth magic.
  Kenku do not appreciate any form of servitude, and so are poor at using
  invocations. Their light avian bodies cannot sustain a great deal of injury.

Demonspawn
  Demonspawn are horrible half-mortal, half-infernal creatures - the flip side
  of the Demigods. Demonspawn can be created in any number of ways: magical
  experiments, breeding, unholy pacts, etc. Although many Demonspawn may
  initially be indistinguishable from those of pure mortal stock, they will
  inevitably grow horns, scales or other unusual features. Powerful members of
  this class of beings also develop a range of unholy abilities, which are
  listed as mutations (and can sometimes be activated with the 'a' command).

  Demonspawn advance quite slowly in experience and learn most skills at about
  the same rate as do Demigods. However, they are a little better at fighting
  and much better at conjurations, summonings, necromancy and invocations. Note
  that unlike Demigods, they can take on gods, although not all will accept
  them.

Elves
========================================

There are a number of distinct species of Elf. Elves are all physically slight
but long-lived people, quicker-witted than Humans, but sometimes slower to learn
new things. Elves are especially good at using those skills which require a
degree of finesse, such as stealth, sword-fighting and archery, but tend to be
poor at using brute force and inelegant forms of combat. They find heavy armour
to be uncomfortable, and make the finest, lightest armours to be found anywhere.
Elves are particularly good at using Elven weapons.

Due to their fey natures, all Elves are good at using magic in general and air
elemental magic in particular, while their affinity for other types of magic
varies among the different sub-species.

High Elves
  This is a tall and powerful Elven species who advance in levels very slowly,
  requiring half again as much experience as Humans. They have good intelligence
  and dexterity, but suffer in strength. Compared with Humans, they have fewer
  HP but more magic. Among all Elves, they are best with blades and bows.

Deep Elves
  This is an Elven species who long ago fled the overworld to live in darkness
  underground. There, they developed their mental powers, evolving a natural
  gift for all forms of magic (including necromancy and earth magic), and
  adapted physically to their new environment, becoming shorter and weaker than
  other elves and losing all colouration. They are poor at hand-to-hand
  combat, but excellent at fighting from a distance. They advance in levels
  slightly faster than High Elves.

Sludge Elves
  This is a somewhat degenerate species of Elves. They are mirror images of
  normal Elves in some respects: they have no special proficiency with bows or
  swords (long or short), nor do they have any aptitude in the traditional areas
  of High Elven magic (enchantments and conjurations). On the other hand, they
  are superlative transmuters, and are comfortable dabbling in necromantic,
  poison and elemental magic. As fighters, they are often more dangerous unarmed
  than armed. They advance in levels slightly slower than Humans.

Dwarves
========================================

Dwarves are generally short, hardy people. Originally inhabiting deep
underground caverns, some of them moved closer to the surface while still
sticking to the mountainous habitat. All Dwarves are particularly dangerous when
using Dwarven weaponry. Their armour and weapons are very well-crafted and much
more durable than the products of lesser artisans.

Mountain Dwarves
  Mountain Dwarves, as opposed to the subterranean specimen, come from cities
  far above the Dungeon. They love to fight, and often venture forth to seek
  fame and fortune through battle. As such, they are very robust and excellent
  at hand combat, especially favouring axes or bludgeoning weapons, and are
  good at using armour and shields. They are poor at missile combat, the
  single exception being crossbows. Polearms usually are too big for them to
  wield comfortably and so make quite bad weapons for Mountain Dwarves.

  In general, they are rather more resistant to magic than capable of
  using it themselves. However, they are very proficient at earth and fire
  magics. Thus, many a Mountain Dwarf started career as an elementalist
  in those schools. They advance in levels at a similar rate to Deep Elves.

Deep Dwarves
  Deep Dwarves are a species who, unlike their Mountain Dwarf relatives, never
  left the underground homelands. Living there for countless generations made
  them turn pale and lose all ability to regenerate on their own (nor are they
  receptive to any effects which merely hasten regeneration), as well as all
  ability to recover from losses to their primary attributes over time. On the
  other hand, Deep Dwarves have developed the ability to instantly counteract
  small doses of damage. Their empathy with the earth makes them sense their
  surroundings; this ability increases in power as they gain experience levels.

  Given their lack of innate healing, few Deep Dwarves venture out for
  adventures or even combat. Those who do bring a wand of healing, or rely on
  divine assistance.

  Naturally, Deep Dwarves are quite adept with all arts of avoiding blows and
  damage and ungifted in the ways of physical combat. Those who have to defend
  their ground most often go with ranged combat (except for bows, which are too
  unwieldy for them) or spells. Deep Dwarves are highly spiritual beings, often
  portrayed as actual spirits by outsiders. They are most at home with the
  magics of earth and death.

  Like all other Dwarves, they are gifted forgers. In addition, Deep Dwarves can
  tinker with gadgets so as to recharge them. However, each time they do so,
  they lose a bit of their magical essence.

The Undead
========================================

As creatures brought back from beyond the grave, the undead are naturally immune
to poisons, negative energy and torment; have little warmth left to be affected
by cold; and are not susceptible to mutations.

There are three types of undead available to players: Mummies, Ghouls and
Vampires.

Mummies
  These are undead creatures who travel into the depths in search of revenge,
  redemption, or just because they want to.

  Mummies progress very slowly in levels, half again as slowly as Humans in all
  skills except fighting, spellcasting and necromancy. As they increase in
  levels, they become increasingly in touch with the powers of death, but cannot
  use some types of necromancy which only affect living creatures. The side
  effects of necromantic magic tend to be relatively harmless to Mummies.
  However, their desiccated bodies are highly flammable. They also do not need
  to eat or drink and, in any case, are incapable of doing so.

Ghouls
  They are horrible undead creatures, slowly rotting away. Although Ghouls can
  sleep in their graves for years on end, when they rise to walk among the
  living, they must eat flesh to survive. Raw flesh is preferred, especially
  rotting or tainted meat, and Ghouls gain resilience from consuming it.

  They aren't very good at doing most things, although they make decent fighters
  and, due to their contact with the grave, can use ice, earth and death magic
  without too many difficulties.

Vampires
  Vampires are another form of undead, but with a peculiarity: by consuming
  fresh blood, they may become alive. A bloodless Vampire has all the traits of
  an undead, but cannot regain lost physical attributes or regenerate from
  wounds over time - in particular, magical items or spells which increase the
  rate of regeneration will not work. On the other hand, a Vampire full with
  blood will regenerate very quickly, but lose all undead powers. Vampires can
  never starve. They can drink from fresh corpses with the 'e' command. Upon
  growing, they learn to transform into quick bats and, later, how to draw
  potions of blood from fresh corpses.

Draconians
========================================

Draconians are human-dragon hybrids: humanoid in form and approximately
human-sized, with wings, tails and scaly skins. Draconians start out in an
immature form with brown scales, but as they grow in power they take on a
variety of colours. This happens at an early stage in their career, and the
colour is determined by chromosomes, not by behaviour.

Some types of Draconians have breath weapons or special resistances. Draconians
advance very slowly in levels, but are reasonably good at all skills but armour
(most types of which they cannot wear) and missile weapons. Still, each colour
has its own strengths and some have complementary weaknesses, which sometimes
requires a bit of flexibility on the part of the player.

Red Draconians
  feel at home in fiery surroundings. They are bad with ice magic but very
  proficient with fire. Their scorchingly hot breath will leave a lingering
  cloud of flame.

White Draconians
  stem from frost-bitten lands, and are naturally resistant to frost. Their
  breath is piercing cold They are
  versed in ice magic, but bad at fire.

Green Draconians
  are used to venomous surroundings and breathe clouds of mephitic vapours.
  They are especially good in the arts of poison and without deficiencies in
  other magic realms. Later on, they will develop a poisonous stinger.

Yellow Draconians
  have a sulphurous breath full of corrosive acid, and later gain an acidic
  bite attack. They are acid resistant, too.

Grey Draconians
  have no breath weapon, but also no need to even breathe at all, allowing
  them to survive in deep water. They are stealthy and good at stabbing.

Black Draconians
  can unleash huge electrical discharges, and are naturally insulated. They
  are good at air magic but feel cumbersome with earth magic.

Mottled Draconians
  are somewhat in touch with fire, yet are not weak with ice. They can spit
  globs of sticky flame a short distance.

Purple Draconians
  are highly adapted to all spellcasting in general, and to hexes and charms
  in particular. They are a bit better at evoking things than most other
  Draconians. They can breathe dispelling energy which strips those it hits of
  their enchantments.

Pale Draconians
  are better at air and fire magic, and have no deficiencies in other schools.
  They breathe steam and, like their Purple cousins, have a slight advantage at
  Evocations.

2.                      LIST OF CHARACTER BACKGROUNDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your quest, you play as one of a large number of different types of
characters. Although each has its own strengths and weaknesses, some are
definitely easier than others, at least to begin with. The best backgrounds for
a beginner are probably Fighters, Gladiators and Berserkers; if you really want
to play a magician, try a Conjurer. However, not all species are equally well
suited for all backgrounds. The lighter coloured choices on the selection screen
are generally considered to be the more accessible ones.

Each background starts out with a different set of skills and items, but from
there you can shape them as you will. Note that due to peculiarities of size or
body shape, some characters start with a different inventory.

Fighters
  Fighters usually start with great weaponry, a suit of heavy armour and a
  shield. They have a good general grounding in the arts of fighting.

Gladiators
  The Gladiator has been trained to fight in the ring, and so is versed in the
  art of fighting, but is not so good at anything else. In fact, Gladiators have
  never learned anything except bashing monsters with heavy things. They start
  with a nasty weapon, light armour, a helmet (if they can wear one) and either
  some nets and javelins or darts.

Monks
  The Monk is a member of an ascetic order dedicated to the perfection of one's
  body and soul through the discipline of the martial arts. Monks start with
  very little equipment, save a ring increasing their melee accuracy, but can
  survive without the weighty weapons and spellbooks needed by characters of
  other backgrounds.

Berserkers
  Berserkers are hardy warriors who worship Trog the Wrathful, from whom they
  get the power to go berserk (as well as a number of other powers, should they
  prove worthy), but who forbids the use of spell magic. They usually enter the
  dungeon with a mace or axe, and dressed in animal skins.

Priests
  Priests serve either Zin, the ancient and revered God of Law. Hill Orcs may
  choose to follow the Orc god Beogh instead. Priests enter the dungeon with a
  traditional weapon and a priestly robe.

Healers
  The Healer is a priest of Elyvilon. Healers begin with minor healing powers,
  but can gain far greater abilities in the long run. They are able to
  persuade monsters to abstain from bloodshed, gaining both piety and experience
  that way.

Chaos Knights
  The Chaos Knight is a plaything of Xom. Xom is a very unpredictable (and
  possibly psychotic) entity who rewards or punishes according to whim.

Death Knights
  The Death Knight is a fighter who aligns him or herself with the powers of
  death and worships Yredelemnul the Dark, who will soon grant the ability to
  re-animate the dead.

Abyssal Knights
  The Abyssal Knight is a fighter serving Lugonu the Unformed, ruler of the
  Abyss. They are granted some power over the Abyss, and must spread death and
  disorder in return.

Crusaders
  The Crusader is a decent fighter who can use the magical arts of enchantment
  to become more dangerous in battle. Crusaders start out lightly armed and
  armoured, but equipped with a book of martial spells.

Warpers
  Warpers specialise in translocation magic, and are experts in travelling long
  distances and positioning themselves precisely and use this to their advantage
  in melee or missile combat.

Arcane Marksmen
  Arcane Marksmen specialise in dealing ranged damage via enchanted weapons.
  They enter the dungeon armed with spells to ensure their foes have difficulty
  approaching them.

Assassins
  An Assassin is a stealthy character who is especially good at killing,
  using daggers or blowguns.

Stalkers
  The Stalker is an Assassin who practices alchemy to prepare dangerous
  potions to use against his or her enemies. They also have means to pass
  through walls to catch foes unaware.

Hunters
  The Hunter is a type of fighter who specialises in missile weapons. A Hunter
  starts with either some throwing weapons or a ranged weapon and a good deal of
  ammunition, as well as an edged weapon and a set of leathers.

Artificers
  Artificers are attuned to gadgets, mechanics and magic elicited from arcane
  items, as opposed to casting magic themselves. As a consequence, they enter
  the Dungeon with an assortment of wands or a rod of striking. Artificers are
  skilled at evoking magical items and finding Traps and Doors, and understand
  the basics of melee combat. Those with wands also have some prior experience
  with scrolls of recharging.

Wanderers
  Wanderers are people who have not learned a specific trade. Instead, they've
  travelled around becoming "jacks-of-all-trades, masters of none". They start
  the game with a large assortment of skills and maybe some small items they
  picked up along the way, but, other than that, they're pretty much on their
  own. Non-human wanderers might not even know which skills they have (since
  they haven't quite learned enough for one full level), and therefore make for
  an additional challenge. You shouldn't expect Human Wanderers to be easy,
  either, as this background is typically harder to play than the others.

Magicians
========================================

A magician is not an available character background by itself, but a type of
background, encompassing Wizards, Conjurers, Enchanters, Summoners,
Necromancers, Transmuters, various Elementalists and Venom Mages. Magicians
are the best at using magic. Among other things, they start with a robe and a
book of spells which should see them through the first several levels.

Wizards
  A Wizard is a magician who does not specialise in any area of magic. Wizards
  start with a variety of magical skills and with Magic Dart memorised. Their
  book allows them to progress in many different branches of the arcane arts.

Conjurers
  The Conjurer specialises in the violent and destructive magic of conjuration
  spells. Like Wizards, the Conjurer starts with the Magic Dart spell.

Enchanters
  The Enchanter specialises in the more subtle area of enchantment magic.
  Although not as directly powerful as conjurations, high-level enchantments
  offer a wide range of very handy effects. The Enchanter begins with lightly
  enchanted weapons and armour, but no direct damage spell (since enchantments
  do not deal with direct attacks). Instead, they begin with the Corona spell
  and some enchanted darts, which should help them out until they can use the
  higher level enchantment spells.

Summoners
  The Summoner specialises in calling creatures from this and other worlds to
  give assistance. Although they can at first summon only very wimpy creatures,
  the more advanced summoning spells allow summoners to call on such powers as
  elementals and demons.

Necromancers
  The Necromancer is a magician who specialises in the less pleasant side of
  magic. Necromantic spells are a varied bunch, but many involve some degree of
  risk or harm to the caster.

Transmuters
  Transmuters specialise in transmutation magic, and can cause strange changes
  in themselves and others.

Venom Mages
  Venom Mages specialise in poison magic, which is extremely useful in the
  shallower levels of the dungeon where few creatures are immune to it. Poison
  is especially effective when used against insects, damaging their tracheae
  quite effectively.

Elementalists
  Elementalists are magicians who specialise in one of the four types of
  elemental magic: air, fire, earth or ice.

  Fire Magic
    tends towards destructive conjurations.

  Ice Magic
    offers a balance between destructive conjurations and protective
    enchantments.

  Air Magic
    provides many useful enchantments in addition to some unique destructive
    capabilities.

  Earth Magic
    is a mixed bag, with destructive, defensive and utility spells available.

3.                             LIST OF SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a description of the skills you may have. You can check your current
skills with the 'm' command, and therein toggle between progress display and
aptitude display using '!'. You can also read the table of aptitudes from the
help menu using '?%', and during character choice with '%'.

Fighting skills
========================================

Fighting is the basic skill used in hand-to-hand combat, and applies no matter
which weapon your character is wielding (if any). Fighting is also the skill
that determines the number of hit points your character gets as they increase in
levels (note that this is calculated so that you don't get a long run advantage
by starting out with a high Fighting skill). The first level of Fighting skill
can be obtained by training melee combat against plants and fungi.

Weapon skills affect your ability to fight with specific melee weapons. Weapon
skills include:

  * Short Blades
  * Long Blades
  * Maces & Flails
  * Axes
  * Staves
  * Polearms

If you are already good at a weapon, say a long sword, and you practise for a
while with a similar weapon such as a short sword, your practise will be sped up
(and will require less experience) until both skills are equal; this is called
crosstraining. Similar types of weapons are:

  * Short Blades and Long Blades
  * Maces & Flails and Axes
  * Polearms and Axes
  * Staves and Polearms
  * Staves and Maces & Flails

Being good at a specific weapon improves the speed with which you can use it by
about 10% every two skill levels. Although lighter weapons are easier to use
initially, as they strike quickly and accurately, heavier weapons increase in
damage potential very quickly as you improve your skill with them.

Unarmed Combat is a special fighting skill. It allows your character to make a
powerful attack when unarmed and also to make special secondary attacks (and
increases the power of those attacks for characters who get them anyway). You
can practise Unarmed Combat by attacking empty-handed, and it is also exercised
when you make a secondary attack (a kick, punch, etc.). Unarmed combat is
particularly difficult to use in combination with heavy armour or shields or
very big weapons. As with Fighting, the first level of this skill can be
obtained by training it against plants and fungi.

Ranged combat skills
========================================

There are a number of individual weapon skills for missile weapons:

  * Throwing (includes blowguns)
  * Bows
  * Crossbows
  * Slings

Throwing is the skill for all things hurled without a launcher: axes, spears,
stones, nets, etc. The other skills refer to various types of missiles shot with
a launcher. An exception to this are needles: these are launched using blowguns,
an action which uses and trains the Throwing skill. Since stones can be thrown
without launchers to good effect, these skills crosstrain:

  * Throwing and Slings

Magic skills
========================================

Spellcasting is the basic skill for magic use. It affects your reserves of
magical energy (Magic) in the same way that Fighting affects your hit points:
every time you increase the Spellcasting skill you gain some magic points and
spell levels. This skill greatly influences the amount by which casting causes
hunger. Spellcasting also helps with the power of your spells, but to a lesser
extent than the more specialised magical skills. This skill is very difficult to
learn, and requires a large amount of practice and experience.

Only those characters with at least one magic skill at level one or above can
learn magical spells. If your character has no magic skills, he or she can learn
the basic principles of the hermetic arts by reading and reciting the spells
inscribed on magical scrolls (this stops being useful once you reach level one
in Spellcasting). Note that characters starting with spells always have at least
one level of Spellcasting.

There are also individual skills for each different type of magic; the higher
the skill, the more powerful the spell. Multidisciplinary spells use an average
of the two or three skills.

Elemental magic is a special case. When you practise an elemental magic skill
(fire, ice, air or earth magic) you will improve much less quickly than normal
if you already have one or more elemental magic skills higher than the one you
are practising. This is especially true if those skills are 'opposed' to the one
you're practising: fire and ice are mutually opposed, as are earth and air.

  Say you have level 2 fire magic, level 4 ice magic and level 1 air magic.
  Practising ice magic won't be a problem. Practising air magic will be a bit
  slow, as you have other elemental skills at higher levels. Practising fire
  magic will be very slow, as you have a higher level in ice magic.

Miscellaneous skills
========================================

Armour
  Heavier body armours give more reliable protection from damage but have
  several disadvantages.

  Having a high Armour skill means that you are used to wearing heavy armour,
  allowing you to move more freely and gain more protection. When you look at an
  armour's description (from within the inventory), you can see in particular
  show you how cumbersome it is. This is measured by the Evasion modifier.

  Walking and fighting in heavy armour will train the Armour skill. This skill
  helps to overcome the evasion penalty of body armours, reduces the amount by
  which heavy armour hamper melee fighting and also mitigates the bad effects of
  heavy armour on spellcasting. A really high Armour skill increases the AC
  provided by other types of armour (gloves, cloaks, etc.).

Dodging
  Not getting hit by weapons, missiles and spells trains Dodging. This is easier
  done in lighter armours. A high Dodging skill helps you to evade attacks
  better. You also train the Dodging skill when wearing a heavy armour, but more
  slowly.

Stealth
  Helps you avoid being noticed. Try not to wear heavy armour or be encumbered
  if you want to be stealthy. Large creatures (like Trolls) are bad at stealth.
  The big exception are Nagas, which are unusually stealthy. Stealth is trained
  by walking around lightly armoured, and especially by walking around
  unnoticed.

Stabbing
  Lets you make a very powerful first strike against a sleeping/resting monster
  who hasn't noticed you yet. This is most effective with a dagger, slightly
  less effective with other short blades and less useful (although by no means
  negligible) with any other weapon.

Shields
  Affects the amount of protection you gain by using a shield, and the degree to
  which it hinders you.

Traps & Doors
  Affects your ability to notice hidden traps and doors and to disarm traps when
  you find them. With this skill at a high level, you will often find hidden
  things without actively looking for them. Note that you scan your vicinity in
  every move (not just with commands like 's', '.' or '5'). Without (or with
  low) Traps & Doors skill, you search only the eight adjacent squares. The area
  covered gets larger with higher skill, as well as the chance to detect
  something.

Invocations
  An easy-to-learn skill which affects your ability to call on your god for aid.
  Those skilled at invoking have reduced fail rates and produce more powerful
  effects. Some gods (such as Trog) do not require followers to learn this
  skill.

  Like Spellcasting, this skill also affects your supply of magic, though
  Invocations gives a bit less than Spellcasting in this regard. In any case,
  these two effects are not cumulative: the higher contribution of Spellcasting
  or Invocations is used.

Evocations
  This skill lets you use wands much more effectively, in terms of both damage
  and precision. Furthermore, with high Evocations, you can easily deduce the
  number of charges in a wand through usage. Similarly, all other items that
  have certain powers (like crystal balls) work better for characters trained in
  this skill. Like Invocations, Evocations is easier to learn than other skills.

  If your character does not have a particular skill, he or she can gain it by
  practising the activities mentioned above.

4.                        LIST OF KEYS AND COMMANDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main screen
========================================

Crawl has many commands to be issued by single key strokes. This can become
confusing, since there are also several modes; here is the full list. Some
commands are particularly useful in combination with certain interface options;
such options are mentioned in the list. For a description of them, please look
into options_guide.txt. For a more terse list of all commands, use '??' in-game.
Most modes (targeting, level map, interlevel travel) also have help menus via
'?' on their own.

Movement
----------------------------------------

direction
  Moves one square, direction is either one of the numpad cursor keys (try both
  Numlock on and off) or  one of the Rogue vi keys (hjklyubn).

Shift-direction or / direction
  This moves straight until something interesting is found (like a monster). If
  the first square is a trap, movement starts nonetheless.

o
  Auto-explore. Setting the option explore_greedy to true makes auto-explore run
  to interesting items (those that get picked up automatically) or piles
  (checking the contents). Autoexploration will open doors on its own except if
  you set easy_open to false.

G or Ctrl-G
  Interlevel travel (to arbitrary dungeon levels or waypoints). Remembers old
  destinations if interrupted. This command has its own set of shortcuts; use ?
  for help on them.

Ctrl-W
  Set waypoint (a digit between 0 and 9). Check the option show_waypoints. You
  can go to a waypoint by pressing Ctrl-G or G and the digit.

Resting and Searching
----------------------------------------

s, Del, . or Numpad 5
  Rests and searches (these are not distinguished) for one turn. This is most
  often used tactically for waiting a few turns. Serious resting or searching
  should be done with the 5 command.

5 or Shift-Numpad 5
  Long resting/searching (until both health and magic points are full or
  something is found or 100 turns are over).

Dungeon interaction
----------------------------------------

O
  Open door. This is usually done automatically by walking into the door, unless
  you set the option easy_open to false.

C
  Close door.

Ctrl-direction or * direction
  Tries to untrap a known trap on the specified square, else opens/closes door
  if there is one, else attacks without move (even if no monster is seen).

<
  Use staircase to go higher or enter a shop or portal.

>
  Use staircase to go deeper or enter a shop or portal.

;
  Examine occupied tile and auto-pickup eligible items. Can also be used to
  pick up only part of a stack with no other item on the same square.

x
  Examine surroundings, see below. Has '?' help.

X
  Examine level map, see below. Has '?' help.

Ctrl-X
  Lists all monsters, items and features in sight. You may read their
  descriptions and travel to an item or feature.

Ctrl-O
  Show dungeon overview (branches, shops, etc.).

!
  Annotate current level. You can enter any text. This annotation is then listed
  in the dungeon overview (Ctrl-O) and also shown whenever you enter that level
  again. If you use this command when standing on a staircase, you may also
  annotate the level that staircase leads to. Should your annotation contain an
  exclamation mark (!), you will be prompted before entering the level. An empty
  string clears annotations.

  gear, and status, mutations, abilities (the latter three more terse than with
  the command @, A, a). This is a highly condensed conglomeration of [, ", E, ^,
  @, A, a, $ on a single screen. Pressing the key of a displayed item views it.

Other game-playing commands
----------------------------------------

a
  Use special ability.

p
  Pray to your god, generally in order to sacrifice some item.

z

Stashes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ctrl-F
  Find. This searches in stashes and shops, you can use regular expressions and
  also terms like 'long blades', 'shop', 'altar', 'artefact'. If you are
  looking for altars to a special god, a search for 'Trog' , etc. works. If all
  items are stashed (the default), then a string like 'D:13' will list all known
  items on that level. 'D:1}' will search for items on level 1 only, as opposed
  to 'D:1', which will also list items on D:10 through D:19. Once the list of
  all found places is displayed, you can cause auto-travel to go there (press
  the associated letter) or you can examine the items (press ? followed by the
  letter).

Ctrl-E
  Excludes a square from stash tracking.

Item interaction (inventory)
========================================

{
  Inscribe item (check the autoinscribe option). An empty inscription or
  inscribing only space will remove prior inscriptions. See Appendix
  6. Inscriptions. You can also inscribe items when viewing them by
  pressing their  slot key in the inventory.

f
  Fire quivered missile. If some monster is in sight, either the last target or
  the nearest monster will be automatically targeted. Pressing f again shoots.

F
  Directly choose an item and fire. Contrary to fi this does not change the
  quiver.

  have claws or wield such a weapon already), cut up a single corpse on the
  ground and switch back to your primary weapon. In case there are several
  corpses on the ground, you are prompted one by one. There, you can answer

  =========  ================================
  y, c       yes (chop up this corpse)
  n, Space:  no (skip this corpse)
  a          yes to all (chop up all corpses)
  q, Esc     stop chopping altogether
  =========  ================================

Shortcuts in lists (like multidrop)
========================================

When dropping (with the drop_mode = multi option), the drop menu accepts several
shortcuts. The same applies to the pickup menu. In the following, if an item is
already selected, the key will deselect it (except for ',' and '-', obviously).

(
  Select all missiles.

)
  Select all hand weapons.

[
  Select all armour.

.
  Selects next item. (If you have pressed the key of an item in the list, '.'
  will toggle the next item. This can be repeated, quickly selecting several
  subsequent items).

Level map ('X')
========================================

The level map (brought up by 'X' in the main screen) uses the whole screen to
show the dungeon. The first line of that screen usually gives the name of the
level and a hint on the help screen. You can use the level_map_title option to
get rid of that.

Esc, Space
  Leave level map.

?
  Level map help.

-
  Scroll level map up.

+
  Scroll level map down.

direction
  Move cursor.

Shift-direction

  character, move cursor to last travel destination instead.

<
  Cycle through up stairs.

>
  Cycle through down stairs.

^
  Cycle through traps.

_
  Cycle through altars.

Tab
  Cycle through shops and portals.

Ctrl-W
  Set waypoint.

W
  Cycle through waypoints.

Travel exclusions mark certain spots of the map as no-go areas for autotravel
and explore.

e
  Set travel exclusion. If an exclusion is already present, change size (from
  single square to full field of vision); after that, remove exclusion.

Ctrl-E
  Erase all travel exclusions at once.

E
  Cycle through travel exclusions.

Examining surroundings ('x')
========================================

When roaming the dungeon, the surroundings mode is activated by 'x'. It lets you
have a look at items or monsters in line of sight. You may also examine stashed
items outside current view using the option target_oos = true (if using this,
check the option target_los_first).

Esc, Space, x
  Return to playing mode.

?
  Special help screen.

* or '
  Cycle objects forward.

/ or ;
  Cycle objects backward.

+ or =
  Cycle monsters forward.

Targeting
========================================

Targeting mode is similar to examining surroundings. It is activated whenever
you fire projectiles, evoke a wand or cast spells which use targets. All of the
commands described for examination of surroundings work, with the exception of
Space (which fires).

Esc or x
  Stop targeting.

?
  Special help screen.

Enter
  Fire at cursor direction (also Del and Space).

.
  Fire at cursor position and stop there with slightly reduced impact. This can
  be useful to avoid damaging pets, or to avoid losing arrows.

p
  Fire at previous target (if still in sight).

f
  Smart-firing: fire at previous target, if it is still in sight; and else fire
  at the cursor position. Together with the default_target option (which is on
  by default) this allows to start shooting at an opponent with 'ff' and then
  keep firing with 'ff'.

:
  Toggle display of the beam path.

Ctrl-F
  Toggle target modes (between enemies, all, friends; see also option
  target_zero_exp).

(, )
  These two commands allow you to change ammunition while targeting. The choice
  is subject to the fire_order option. Usually, you change missiles according to
  your launcher; i.e. when wielding a bow, ( and ) will cycle through all stacks
  of arrows in your inventory.

Shift-direction
  Fire straight in that direction. You can go back to the old targeting mode
  (allowing straight firing by pressing just the direction key) using the
  option target_unshifted_dirs. Note that target_unshifted_dirs is mutually
  exclusive with default_target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.                          LIST OF ENCHANTMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stats area has room for showing the enchantments which you currently enjoy
or have to suffer. Generally, these are only shown for temporary effects, so
a Kenku's native flying ability is not noted, and neither is the effect of a
ring of regeneration. A list of these enchantments follows, as some are
either abbreviated or may have unusual effects.

General enchantments
========================================

Hungry
  Most species can eat chunks of corpses only if hungry.

Very Hungry
  You are even hungrier than usual.

Near Starving
  You are in desperate need of food.

Starving
  You should really eat something; death is not far away.

Full
  You have eaten a lot.

Very Full
  You have eaten almost all you can for now.

Engorged
  You can't eat any more for now.

Sick
  You are sick, usually from bad food. Hit points don't regenerate until cured
  (wait it out or quaff a potion of healing). Occasionally a primary attribute
  might drop.

Pois
  You are poisoned and continually lose hit points. There are several levels of
  poisoning. Cure with potions of healing or by waiting it out.

Pray
  You are praying. This can have different effects depending on your religion.

Encumbered
  Your load is heavy enough to slow you down. You also need more food when
  walking around encumbered. Try to avoid this!

Overloaded
  You carry too much to do anything sensible. Drop stuff!

Conf
  You are confused. Actions may not work properly. Wait it out or drink a potion
  of healing for immediate cure.

Fast
  All of your actions are twice as fast (this can cause magic contamination).

Swift
  You move at a somewhat higher speed. This only means movement speed.

Slow
  All actions are slowed. Note: ending berserking will slow you.

Special enchantments
========================================

Breath
  Some abilites (like Draconian breath weapons and Naga
  poison spit) require you to catch your breath in between
  uses. These abilities cannot be re-used until the Breath
  status disappears.

Invis
  You are invisible. This can cause glowing if used too much.

Tele
  You are about to teleport, i.e. feeling "unstable". If you are about to
  teleport, another teleport (by any source) will cancel it.

Lev
  You levitate a few inches above the ground. While this is enough to cross
  water and lava, movement is not completely controlled. It will usually time
  out.

Fly
  You fly, gaining the benefits of levitation with none of the drawbacks.
  Flying provides an additional speed bonus to swiftness.

Held
  You are held in a net. You cannot move freely and will instead try to fight
  your way out of the net.

Mesm
  You are mesmerised and cannot move away from the monster(s) mesmerising you.

Fire
  You are covered with sticky fire. It will hurt you for a few turns, probably
  burning scrolls in the process. Drop the most important ones!

Regen
  You regenerate hit points at an unnaturally fast rate. This is only shown for
  temporary regeneration.

Glow
  You glow from mutagenic radiation. This can mutate you over time, usually with
  a bad outcome. The colour indicates the severity: the first level (grey) is
  only a warning, and no mutation will occur from it.

RMsl
  You repel missiles, i.e. there's a good chance to evade them.

DMsl
  You deflect missiles, i.e. there's a great chance to evade them. Still, this
  protection is not bulletproof.

Rot
  This is a very harmful, necromantic ailment. You will lose maximum hit points
  over time. Only healing potions and wands or and certain abilities restore
  these. The rotting itself is cured with potions of healing or by waiting it
  out.

Ins
  You are insulated, i.e. resistant to electric shocks.

Touch
  Your hands are glowing, and any monster you touch might become confused.

Blade
  You are bonded with your blade, so it strikes more accurately.

-MR
  You are more vulnerable to hostile enchantments.

MR
  You are more resistant to hostile enchantments.

There are several more enchantment messages for various spells. The description
of the spell causing the enchantment will explain these.

6.                              INSCRIPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the { command to manually inscribe items; alternatively, you can
also inscribe when viewing items from the inventory (done by pressing the item's
letter). This adds a note in curly braces to the item description. Besides
simply allowing you to make comments about items, there are several further
uses.

Automatic inscriptions
========================================

These are done by the game to help you to identify items. For example, rings or
scrolls which did not do anything obvious upon first use will be automatically
inscribed with "{tried}".

Inscriptions as shortcuts
========================================

You can use inscriptions to define shortcuts for easy access to items,
regardless of their actual inventory letter. For example, if an item's
inscription contains "@w9", you can type 'w9' in order to wield it. Instead of
the 9, any other digit works as well. And instead of 'w'ield, any other command
used for handling items can be used: 'e'at, r'ead, 'q'uaff, 'z'ap, 'f'ire, etc.
Using "@*9" will make any action command followed by '9' use this item.

Safety inscriptions
========================================

Inscriptions containing the following strings affect the behaviour of some
commands:

!*
  prompt before any action using this item

!w
  prompt before wielding and unwielding

!a
  prompt before attacking when wielding this item. Non-weapons and ranged
  weapons prompt automatically. Also, if you answer 'y', you won't be prompted
  again until you switch weapons.

!d
  prompt before dropping

!e
  prompt before eating

!q
  prompt before quaffing

!r
  prompt before reading

!f
  prompt before firing or throwing

!W
  prompt before wearing armour

!T
  prompt before taking off armour

!P
  prompt before putting on jewellery

!R
  prompt before removing jewellery

!v
  prompt before evoking an item

!Q
  prompt before explicitly quivering an item

!p
  prompt before sacrificing a stack containing an item with this inscription; if
  the answer is "No", the whole stack will be skipped, and no items will be
  sacrificed

=p
  prompt before sacrificing this particular item; if the answer is "No", then
  Crawl will go on to sacrifice further items in the stack

=g
  item will be picked up automatically if autopickup is on

=k
  item will be ignored in all listings on the ground (it can still be picked up
  if all items on the ground have this inscription)

=s
  If stash tracking is explicit, then dropping this item will cause a stash to
  automatically be marked.

=f
  item is excluded when cycling ammunition and from automatic quivering

+f
  item is included when cycling ammunition and in automatic quivering

!D
  prompt before performing an action that might destroy this item. If you're
  attempting to destroy an item thus inscribed by sacrificing it, destroying a
  weapon or burning a book in the names of various deities, the game won't even
  ask you for confirmation but silently ignore this item. It also protects
  against accidentally casting Sticks to Snakes on your favourite weapon.
  However, it won't protect against lava accidents or hungry jellies.

You can use the autoinscribe option to have some items automatically inscribed.
See options_guide.txt for details. Some examples are::

  autoinscribe = royal jell:=g
  autoinscribe = wand of healing:!v

Artefacts autoinscriptions
========================================

Many players use inscriptions for properties of artefacts. This makes browsing
the inventory or stashes easier. Crawl provides a scheme for automatic
inscription (you can switch this off using the option
autoinscribe_artefacts=false).

Here, one has to negotiate between two concurrent objectives: terseness for
better use of limited line lengths versus verboseness for easier reading. The
default inscriptions use the following general ideas:

rXXX
  signifies a resistance

+XXX
  signifies an ability you can evoke via the 'a' command

-XXX
  signifies a suppressed ability

XXX+
  is a stronger version of property XXX

XX+6
  means a boost to some numerical stat (similar with XX-2, etc.)

  one level of cold resistance

Debugging inscriptions
========================================

If you've entered wizard mode, then you can change the zapping range of a wand
by inscribing it with 'range:number' (e.g., 'range:50').  This only works for
wands zapped by the player.
