TABLES OF APTITUDES

The following three tables describe all aptitudes of the various species
for the various skills. These are not necessary for winning in Crawl,
neither explicit nor implicit. The qualitative information behind this
sheet (i.e., which species is good at which tasks) can be obtained in
two other, less sophisticated ways:
- Read the species section in the manual about strengths and weaknesses.
- Look at which combinations of species and background are recommended
  (lightgrey).

If you consider figuring out such things yourself to be fun, stop
reading now. Otherwise, just go ahead.

 -5  abysmal aptitude
 -4  terrible aptitude (learning half as fast as Humans)
 -3  very poor aptitude
 -2  poor aptitude
 -1  slightly disfavoured aptitude
  0  standard aptitude (Humans)
 +1  slightly favoured aptitude
 +2  strong aptitude
 +3  very strong aptitude
 +4  outstanding aptitude (learning twice as fast as Humans)
 +5  exceptional aptitude

Please note that many things affect how quickly a character will actually
learn a skill. Thus, the numbers below are good enough for comparisons among
species, but not necessarily among skills.

The Experience value (Exp) is special and indicates how much experience has
to be earned in order to gain a new level. Here 100 is the Human standard,
and all other species (apart from Halfling, Kobold, Hill Orc) are slower.

The abbreviations used for the skills are:
