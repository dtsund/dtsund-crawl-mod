Derrick 'dtsund' Sund, Ben 'krelbel' Morris, and Kiyoshi 'Aerdan' Aman are
indebted to the following people in the making of this fork.

* Linley Henzell, the author of Dungeon Crawl, for writing this great game.

* Brent Ross, Dungeon Crawl 4.0/4.1 maintainer. Stone Soup, and by extension
  Crawl Light, owes a lot to his ideas and code in Crawl 4.1.

* The Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup team, for keeping Dungeon Crawl alive, for
  making some truly impressive interface improvements to the game, and for
  what good ideas and code cleanup they've incorporated into the game.

* Kiyoshi "Aerdan" Aman, for hosting http://crawl.aerdan.org.

* The people of #TalkingTime, ##arena, and everyone else who has played this
  fork and contributed feedback and/or given me ideas.  Particular thanks to
  Kalir, Cait, and Alex "ais523" Smith.

It is my sincere hope to be able to expand the first sentence of this document 
in the future!
