scroll of enchant weapon i

This scroll places an enchantment on the wielded weapon or stack of missiles, making it more accurate in combat. It may fail to affect weapons or ammunition already heavily enchanted, and will only enchant them up to +9. When used on ammunition this will also decrease the chances of missiles breaking upon impact.
