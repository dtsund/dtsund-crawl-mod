A gate to the Realm of Zot

This gate leads to the Realm of Zot, the final stage of your quest as its deepest level houses the infamous Orb of Zot.

%%%%
A gateway to a bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by travelling from place to place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain. Once you hear the clinking of coins, be sure to hurry up and find the impromptu marketplace before the caravan moves on!

Also be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave quickly, probably to sell them elsewhere.

%%%%
A shaft

A deep hole. Who knows where you might end up if you were to fall through it?
%%%%
A shattered altar of Ashenzari

This crystal altar shattered to pieces when Ashenzari was cursed centuries ago. But still, there is power here: a dark aura holds the shards in mid-explosion, suspended in time and space much like the god they herald.
%%%%
A shimmering altar of Xom

This altar constantly shimmers in all visible colours and probably some invisible ones, too, matching the whims of Xom the Unpredictable, to whom it is dedicated.
%%%%
A shop

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a secretive and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with, grants no refunds, and is interested in nothing you may have to sell.

%%%%
%%%%
A trap

It's a trap!
%%%%
A tree

While the dungeon is filled with dim magic light, in most places it is not bright enough to sustain any larger plants. It is uneven, though, and there are spots where, with the grace of Fedhas, trees as big as those on the surface can grow underground.

%%%%
An open door

A wooden door. You can close it by standing next to it and {{
if crawl.is_tiles() then

%%%%
Some deep water

This water is as deep as it is dangerous. No sane traveller would try to set foot into it, apart from those who fly or swim. Let it be a warning for you: many confused adventurers found their death at the depths, and an untimely end of levitation drowned even more hopeful trespassers.
%%%%
Some lava

An intensely hot pool of molten rock, emitting clouds of sulphurous smoke.
%%%%
Some shallow water

This waist-deep, misty water makes movement and combat cumbersome for landlubbers - sometimes dangerous, but never directly fatal.
