%%%%
Abjuration

This spell attempts to send hostile summoned creatures to the place whence they came, or at least shorten their stay in the caster's locality.
%%%%
Agony

This spell cuts the resilience of a target creature in half, although it will never cause death directly.
%%%%
Airstrike

This spell causes the air around a creature to twist itself into a whirling vortex of meteorological fury. This spell is especially effective against flying enemies.
%%%%
Alistair's Intoxication

This spell works by converting a small portion of brain matter into alcohol, confusing all intelligent humanoids within the caster's view (although poison-resistant creatures will suffer no negative effects). It is strongly focused on the caster, however, and so poison resistance will not protect them. It is frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Animate Dead

This spell causes the dead to rise up and serve the caster; every corpse within a certain distance of the caster is affected. By means of this spell, powerful casters could press into service an army of the mindless undead. Note that zombies are incapable of leaving the level they were created on.
%%%%
Animate Skeleton

This spell raises an inert skeleton to a state of unlife, even if that skeleton is still encased in flesh! Note that skeletons are incapable of leaving the level they were created on.
%%%%
Apportation

This spell allows the caster to pull the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor near the caster. The mass of the target item(s) will make the task more difficult, with some items too massive to ever be moved by this spell. Using this spell on a group of items can be risky; insufficient power will cause some of the items to be lost in the infinite void.

Extremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist the pull of this spell.
%%%%
Berserker Rage

This spell sends the caster into a temporary psychotic rage.
%%%%
Blade Hands

This spell causes long, scythe-shaped blades to grow from the caster's hands. It makes spellcasting somewhat difficult. This spell is not powerful enough to force a cursed weapon from the caster's hands.
%%%%
Blink

This spell randomly translocates the caster a short distance.
%%%%
Bolt of Cold

This spell hurls a great bolt of ice and frost.
%%%%
Bolt of Draining

This spell hurls a deadly bolt of negative energy, which drains the life from any living creature it strikes.
%%%%
Bolt of Fire

This spell hurls a great bolt of flames.
%%%%
Bolt of Inaccuracy

This spell inflicts enormous damage upon any creature struck by the bolt of incandescent energy conjured into existence. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to aim and very rarely hits anything. Pity, that.
%%%%
Iron Shot

This spell hurls a large and heavy metal bolt at the caster's foe.
%%%%
Bolt of Magma

This spell hurls a sizzling bolt of molten rock.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification

This spell instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently lessens his or her resilience to injury - to a degree dependent on (and inversely related to) magical skill.

The spell is powerful enough to literally pull someone out of the Death's Door, albeit the shock will render the caster incapable for a while.
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar

This spell summons a canine to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Call Imp

This spell calls forth a minor demon from the pits of Hell.
%%%%
Cause Fear

This spell causes fear in those near to the caster.
%%%%
Chain Lightning

This spell releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs from target to target until it grounds out.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Degeneration

This spell transforms one creature into a pulsating mass of flesh.
%%%%
Condensation Shield

This spell causes a disc of dense vapour to condense out of the air surrounding the caster. It acts like a normal shield, but its density (and therefore stopping power) depends upon the caster's skill with Ice Magic. The disc is controlled by the caster's mind and thus will not conflict with the wielding of a two-handed weapon.
%%%%
Confuse

This spell induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch

This spell enchants the caster's hands with magical energy. This energy is released when the caster touches a monster with their bare hands, and may induce a state of confusion in the monster.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning

This spell allows the conjurer to create ball lightning. Using the spell is not without risk - ball lightning can be difficult to control.
%%%%
Conjure Flame

This spell creates a column of roaring flame.
%%%%
Control Teleport

This spell allows the caster to control translocations. Be wary that controlled teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy.
%%%%
Control Undead

This spell attempts to enslave any undead in the vicinity of the caster.
%%%%
Controlled Blink

This spell allows short-range translocation, with precise control. Be wary that controlled teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy.
%%%%
Corona

This spell causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature. This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and thereby makes the affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corpse Rot

This spell rapidly accelerates the decomposition of any corpses lying around the caster, emitting in the process a foul miasmic vapour, which eats away at the life force of any creature it envelops.
%%%%
Cure Poison

This spell removes poison from the caster's system.
%%%%
Darkness

This spell dims the light of the dungeon, reducing the range of vision. The area affected is quite large and it doesn't have sharp edges, thus the effect is unlikely to alert anyone not very close to the caster.
%%%%
Death Channel

This spell raises living creatures slain by the caster and his or her allies into a state of unliving slavery as spectral things.
%%%%
Death's Door

This spell is extremely powerful, but carries a degree of risk. It renders living casters nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but
can bring them dangerously close to death. So close in fact, that the body believes itself to be dead - healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. Being more skilled at Necromancy leaves the caster more resilient. Undead cannot use this spell.
%%%%
Debugging Ray

A ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles

This spell protects the caster from any kind of projectile attack, although particularly powerful attacks (lightning bolts, etc.) are deflected to a lesser extent than lighter missiles.
%%%%
Delayed Fireball

Successfully casting this spell gives the caster the ability to instantaneously release a fireball at a later time. Knowing this spell allows the learner to memorise Fireball for no additional spell levels.
%%%%
Demonic Horde

This spell calls forth a small swarm of small demons to do battle with the caster's foes (and sometimes with each other!).
%%%%
Detect Creatures

This spell allows the caster to detect any creatures within a certain radius.
%%%%
Detect Items

This spell detects any items lying about the caster's general vicinity.
%%%%
Detect Secret Doors

This spell is beloved by lazy dungeoneers everywhere, for it can greatly reduce time-consuming searches.
%%%%
Detect Traps

This spell reveals traps in the caster's vicinity.
%%%%
Dig

This spell forms tunnels through unworked rock by liquefying it.
%%%%
Disintegrate

This spell violently rends apart anything in a small volume of space. It can be used to cause severe damage.
%%%%
Dispel Undead

This spell uses the very forces that bind an undead creature together to inflict a great deal of damage on it.
%%%%
Dispersal

This spell tries to teleport away any monsters directly beside the caster.
%%%%
Dragon Form

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a great, fire-breathing dragon.
%%%%
Enslavement

This spell causes an otherwise hostile creature to fight on your side for a while.
%%%%
Ensorcelled Hibernation

This spell tries to lower its target's metabolic rate, inducing hypothermic hibernation. It may have side effects on cold-blooded creatures.
%%%%
Evaporate

This spell heats a potion to the point that it explodes when thrown. The resultant steam is then transmuted into a large cloud, the type of which varies from potion to potion. Of course, the volatile potion must be thrown immediately for the spell to work.
%%%%
Excruciating Wounds

This spell temporarily infuses the weapon held by the caster with the essence of pain itself. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments. Note that unlike other brands, pain can not be made permanent by reading a scroll of vorpalise weapon.
%%%%
Fire Brand

This spell sets a weapon or launcher held by the caster ablaze. It will not affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Fire Storm

This spell creates a mighty storm of roaring flame.
%%%%
Fireball

This spell hurls an exploding bolt of fire. This spell does not cost additional spell levels if the learner already knows Delayed Fireball.
%%%%
Flame Tongue

This spell creates a short burst of flame.
%%%%
Flight

This spell grants to the caster the ability to fly through the air.
%%%%
Freeze

This spell freezes a creature. This may temporarily slow the metabolism of a cold-blooded creature.
%%%%
Freezing Aura

This spell surrounds a weapon or launcher held by the caster with an aura of freezing cold. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Freezing Cloud

This spell conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%
Fulsome Distillation

This spell extracts the vile and poisonous essences from a corpse. You probably don't want to drink the results. The type of potion produced corresponds roughly to the effects of eating said corpse.
%%%%
Major Healing

This spell heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Haste

This spell speeds the actions of a creature. Hasting yourself will increase your magical contamination.
%%%%
Haunt

This spell calls wraiths and ghosts to haunt the caster's target. Calling on the undead exacts a toll on the caster's health, however.
%%%%
Hellfire

This spell should only be available from Dispater's staff. So how are you reading this?
%%%%
Throw Icicle

This spell throws forth a shard of ice. It is particularly effective against those creatures not immune to the effects of freezing. But as most of its destructive potential comes from strong impact and cutting edges, even cold-resistant creatures are notably affected.
%%%%
Ice Form

This spell temporarily transforms the caster's body into a frozen ice-creature, light enough to float on water.
%%%%
Ice Storm

This spell conjures forth a raging blizzard of ice, sleet and freezing gasses.
%%%%
Ignite Poison

This spell attempts to convert all poison within the caster's view into liquid flame. It is very effective against poisonous creatures or those carrying poison potions. The caster and his gear are not affected.
%%%%
Insulation

This spell protects the caster from electric shocks.
%%%%
Invisibility

This spell hides a creature from the sight of others. While invisible you will gain magical contamination, which may eventually cause enough glow to make you visible again.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast

This spell throws a crackling sphere of destructive energy.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction

This spell liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through. Any attempt to move through the liquefied ground will be a very slow one.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction

This spell fragments a wall into an explosion of deadly shrapnel. It can also be used directly on monsters made of wall-like substances.
%%%%
Lehudib's Crystal Spear

This spell hurls a lethally sharp bolt of crystal.
%%%%
Minor Healing

This spell heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Lethal Infusion

This spell infuses a weapon held by the caster with unholy energies. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Levitation

This spell allows the caster to float in the air.
%%%%
Lightning Bolt

This spell hurls a mighty bolt of lightning. Although this spell inflicts less damage than similar fire and ice spells, it can at once rip through whole rows of creatures.
%%%%
Magic Dart

This spell hurls a small bolt of magical energy. It never misses.
%%%%
Malign Gateway

This spell tears a gash in reality, creating a self-sustained but thankfully temporary portal to an unknown, tainted otherworld. Which dastardly denizens of this place might choose to poke their tentacled appendages through, nobody knows, but certainly nobody would want to be nearby when it happens.
%%%%
Mass Confusion

This spell causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Maxwell's Silver Hammer

This spell bestows a lethal but temporary gravitic field to a crushing implement held by the caster. It will not affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud

This spell conjures up a large but short-lived cloud of vile fumes.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation

This spell tries to lower the metabolic rate of every creature within the caster's view enough to induce hypothermic hibernation. It may have side effects on cold-blooded creatures.
%%%%
Necromutation

This spell first transforms the caster into a semi-corporeal apparition receptive to negative energy, then infuses that form with the powers of Death. The caster becomes resistant to cold, poison, magic and hostile negative energies.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance

This spell bathes the caster's surroundings in a sickly green light, inflicting poison on everything in sight (including the caster).
%%%%
Orb of Destruction

This spell conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and a nascent orb won't do the full damage it is capable of.

It is said that most copies of this spell suffer from a scribal error that makes the orbs unstable beyond a short range. Certain individuals may have access to spellbooks without this flaw, so beware!
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour

This spell envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of ice, the power of which depends on his or her skill with ice magic. The caster and the caster's equipment will not suffer cold from this layer, yet can be affected by other sources of cold normally. The spell will not function for casters already wearing heavy armour (any body armour with an evasion penalty of 2 or more). The effects of this spell are boosted if the caster is in ice form.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration

This spell drains the heat from the caster and his or her surroundings, causing harm to all creatures not resistant to cold.
%%%%
Pain

This spell inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature. The caster suffers minor damage from the backlash.
%%%%
Paralyse

This spell prevents a creature from moving.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria

This spell opens a gateway (one side at a time), which allows instantaneous transport to the other opening to any creature entering it.
%%%%
Passwall

This spell tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock. This can be dangerous, since it takes time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which time they will be helpless.
%%%%
Petrify

This spell attempts to petrify a monster. If successful, the monster is slowed down for a while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, a monster will take less damage upon being hit.
%%%%
Phase Shift

This spell allows the caster to phase in and out of the material plane, allowing them to occasionally avoid blows entirely.
%%%%
Poison Arrow

This spell hurls a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. No living thing is completely immune to its effects, and even the undead will take damage from the physical component of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Weapon

This spell temporarily coats any weapon or launcher with poison. It will only work on weapons without an existing enchantment; it also doesn't work on blunt weapons.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud

This spell conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gasses.
%%%%
Polymorph Other

This spell randomly alters the form of another creature. It is especially effective against shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Portal Projectile

This spell teleports a fired or thrown missile directly to its target, greatly increasing its accuracy (but not damage).
%%%%
Projected Noise

This spell produces a noise emanating from a place of the caster's own choosing.
%%%%
Recall

This spell is greatly prized by summoners and necromancers, as it allows the caster to recall any friendly creatures nearby to a position adjacent to the caster.
%%%%
Regeneration

This spell reanimates parts of the caster's wounds. This unholy act dramatically but temporarily increases the caster's recuperative abilities, while also increasing the rate of food consumption.
%%%%
Repel Missiles

This spell reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster. Even powerful attacks such as lightning bolts or dragon breath are affected, although smaller missiles are repelled to a much greater extent.
%%%%
Resist Poison

This spell protects the caster from exposure to all poisons for a period of time.
%%%%
Ring of Flames

This spell surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of searing flame, and keeps other fire clouds away from the caster. This spell attunes the caster to the forces of fire, increasing their fire magic and giving protection from fire. However, it also makes them much more susceptible to the forces of ice.
%%%%
Sandblast

This spell creates a short blast of high-velocity particles. It works best when the caster provides some source (by wielding a stone), but will do what it can with whatever ambient grit is available.
%%%%
See Invisible

This spell enables the caster to perceive things that are shielded from ordinary sight.
%%%%
Selective Amnesia

This spell allows the caster to selectively erase one spell from memory to recapture the magical energy bound up with it.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures

This spell weaves a creature from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter. The creature thus brought into existence will recreate some type of creature found in the caster's immediate vicinity. The spell even creates appropriate equipment for the creature, which are given a lasting substance by their firm contact with reality.
%%%%
Shatter

This spell causes a burst of concussive force around the caster, which will damage most creatures, although those composed of stone, metal or crystal, or otherwise brittle, will particularly suffer. The magic has been known to adversely affect walls.
%%%%
Shock

This spell throws a bouncing bolt of electricity.
%%%%
Silence

This spell eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting spells, praying or yelling in the caster's vicinity impossible. (Applies to caster too, of course.) This spell will not hide your presence, since its oppressive, unnatural effect will almost certainly alert any living creature that something is very wrong.
Silence starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink, eventually covering only the caster, before the effect times out. Some creatures, such as demons, cast magic without speaking and so will be unaffected, and those with innate magical abilities will also still be able to use them.
%%%%
Simulacrum

This spell uses a piece of flesh in hand to create a replica of the original being out of ice. This magic is unstable so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud, if it isn't hacked or melted into a small puddle of water first. Note that simulacra are incapable of leaving the level they were created on.
%%%%
Slow

This spell slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Smiting

This spell smites one creature of the caster's choice.
%%%%
Spider Form

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature. Spellcasting is slightly more difficult in this form. While in this form, you can cling to walls.
%%%%
Static Discharge

This spell releases electric charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to adjacent monsters (or even the caster) before they eventually ground out.
%%%%
Statue Form

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a slow-moving (but extremely robust) stone statue, capable of dealing monstrous blows with bare hands.
%%%%
Sticks to Snakes

This spell uses wooden items in the caster's grasp as raw material for a powerful transmutation. Note that magical artefacts will not be affected.
%%%%
Sticky Flame

This spell conjures a sticky glob of liquid fire, which will adhere to and burn any creature it strikes.
%%%%
Sting

This spell throws a magical dart of poison.
%%%%
Stone Arrow

This spell hurls a sharp spine of rock outward from the caster.
%%%%
Stoneskin

This spell hardens one's skin to a degree determined by one's skill in Earth Magic. It only works on relatively normal flesh, and will aid neither the undead nor the bodily transformed. However, there is one exception: the effects of this spell will be boosted for casters in Statue Form.
%%%%
Striking

This spell hurls a small bolt of force.
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood

This spell converts flesh, blood and other bodily fluids into magical energy. Casters may focus this spell on their own bodies (which can be dangerous but never directly lethal) or can wield freshly butchered flesh in order to draw power into themselves.
%%%%
Summon Butterflies

This spell creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!
%%%%
Summon Demon

This spell opens a gate to the realm of Pandemonium and draws forth one of its inhabitants to serve the caster for a time (although the demon's servitude is by no means guaranteed).
%%%%
Summon Dragon

This spell summons and binds a powerful dragon to perform the caster's bidding.
%%%%
Summon Elemental

This spell calls forth a spirit from the elemental planes to aid the caster. A large quantity of the desired element must be available; this is rarely a problem for earth and air, but may be for fire or water. The elemental will usually be friendly to casters - especially those skilled in the appropriate form of elemental magic.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon

This spell calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster. Beware, for the spell binding it to service may not outlast that which binds it to this world!
%%%%
Summon Horrible Things

This spell opens a gate to the Abyss and calls through one or more hideous abominations from that dreadful place. The powers who answer this invocation require of casters a portion of their intellect in exchange for this service.
%%%%
Summon Hydra

This spell summons a hydra to fight alongside the caster.
%%%%
Summon Ice Beast

This spell calls forth a beast of ice to serve the caster.
%%%%
Summon Scorpions

This spell summons one or more scorpions (some of which may not be bound to the caster's service).
%%%%
Summon Small Mammals

This spell summons one or two small creatures to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Summon Swarm

This spell summons forth a pestilential swarm.
%%%%
Summon Ugly Thing

This spell summons a mutated otherworldly creature to the caster's aid. The hideous thing may not appreciate being called.
%%%%
Sure Blade

This spell forms a mystical bond between the caster and a wielded short blade, making the blade much easier to use.
%%%%
Swiftness

This spell imbues its caster with the ability to achieve great movement speeds. Flying spellcasters can move even faster.
%%%%
Teleport Other

This spell randomly translocates another creature.
%%%%
Teleport Self

This spell teleports the caster to a random location.
%%%%
Throw Flame

This spell throws a small bolt of flame.
%%%%
Throw Frost

This spell throws a small bolt of frost.
%%%%
Tornado

This spell turns the air around the caster in a mighty vortex, doing tremendous damage to everyone caught in it. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the caster. Everything not firmly nailed down will be lifted and tossed around.

The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. Maintaining the winds makes casting of other spells more difficult.

As a side effect, this spell may be used to cross lava, but beware of its short duration.
%%%%
Tukima's Dance

This spell causes a weapon held in the caster's hand to dance into the air and strike the caster's enemies. It will not function on certain wilful artefacts; any abilities that require evocation skill won't be used either.
%%%%
Tukima's Ball

This spell causes weapons on the ground near the caster to all leap into the air and dance together.
%%%%
Twisted Resurrection

This spell allows its caster to imbue a mass of deceased flesh with a magical life force. Casting this spell involves the assembling of several corpses together; the greater the combined mass of flesh available, the greater the chances of success.
%%%%
Vampiric Draining

This spell steals the life of a living creature and grants it to the caster. Life will not be drained in excess of what the caster can capably absorb.
However, attempting to drain an undead or demonic creature will backfire on the caster.
%%%%
Venom Bolt

This spell throws a bolt of poison.
%%%%
Warp Weapon

This spell temporarily binds a localized warp field to the invoker's weapon. Note that unlike other brands, distortion can not be made permanent by reading a scroll of vorpalise weapon.
%%%%
