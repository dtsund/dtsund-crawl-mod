Zin

Zin is a God for those focused on inner strength. Followers must remain pure of body and soul, refraining from unholy, evil, unclean or chaotic magic; the use of mutations and the consumption of intelligent beings' flesh. They may preach to or imprison the unenlightened, and can ultimately gain a divine refuge. Zin values selflessness and long-standing faith. Zin's followers can safely convert to Elyvilon and the Shining One.
%%%%
The Shining One

The Shining One is a powerful deity on a crusade against all evil. Followers and their allies may be granted various blessings upon mercilessly slaying evil and unholy beings. Worshippers must never use unholy or evil magic, and are expected to prove their moral superiority by fighting honourably. Long-standing persistence is appreciated. The Shining One does not mind shifting worship to Elyvilon or Zin.
%%%%
Kikubaaqudgha

Kikubaaqudgha is a terrible Demon-God, served by those who wish to indulge in the powers of death. Kikubaaqudgha is evil, and requires the deaths of living creatures and demons as often as possible.
%%%%
Yredelemnul

Yredelemnul the Dark is an evil God worshipped by those who seek powers over death and the undead. Followers, who must oppose all things holy, can raise legions of servile undead, and gain a number of other useful (if unpleasant) powers. Yredelemnul appreciates killing, but prefers corpses to be put to use rather than sacrificed. Destroying artificial beings is also favoured, as they are neither truly alive nor subject to death or undeath.
%%%%
Xom

Xom is a wild and unpredictable God of chaos, who seeks not worshippers but playthings with which to toy. Many choose to follow Xom in the hope of receiving fabulous rewards and mighty powers, but Xom is nothing if not capricious. Also, there is nothing a follower can do to influence Xom's mood.
%%%%
Vehumet

Vehumet is a God of the destructive powers of magic. Followers gain various useful powers to enhance their command of the hermetic arts, and the most favoured stand to gain access to some of the fearsome spells in Vehumet's library. One's devotion to Vehumet can be proven by the causing of as much carnage and destruction as possible.
%%%%
Okawaru

Okawaru is a dangerous and powerful God of battle. Followers can gain a number of powers useful in combat as well as various rewards, but must constantly prove themselves through battle and the sacrifice of corpses. Okawaru despises those who harm their allies.
%%%%
Makhleb

%%%%
Sif Muna

Sif Muna the Loreminder is a contemplative but powerful deity, served by those who seek magical knowledge. The Loreminder appreciates the training of spell casting skills.
%%%%
Trog

Trog is an ancient God of anger and violence. Followers are expected to kill in Trog's name and sacrifice the dead, and in return gain power in battle and also occasional rewards. Trog hates all wizards, and loves to see their spellbooks burn. Followers are forbidden the use of spell magic.
%%%%
Nemelex Xobeh

Nemelex is a strange and unpredictable trickster God, whose powers can be invoked through the magical packs of cards painted in the ichor of demons. Followers are expected to sedulously sacrifice valuable items, the type of which will influence the gifts. Followers are also advised to trust in the cards and use them as much as possible. However, the Trickster can ensure that fortune favours the bold.
%%%%
Elyvilon

Elyvilon the Healer welcomes all good souls who are prepared for long worship and devotion. Those individuals can expect to gain powerful healing abilities. The Healer prefers a creed of pacifism, and helps worshippers avoid bloodshed. Elyvilon appreciates the destruction of weapons. Being a good God, Elyvilon does not mind if worshippers shift to one of the two allied Gods, Zin or the Shining One.
%%%%
Lugonu

Lugonu the Unformed revels in the chaos of the Abyss. Followers are sent out to cause bloodshed and corruption in the overworld, and must do so unflaggingly to earn this evil God's favour.
%%%%
Beogh

Beogh is the deity worshipped by the cave orcs native to parts of the dungeon. Only orcs may devote their service to Beogh, and must prove their devotion by bloodshed and the blessing of dead orcs. Devout followers of Beogh can smite their foes, and especially fervent devotees of Beogh may even gain followers of their own, for the orcs still look for their Messiah.
%%%%
Fedhas

Fedhas Madash is the god of plant and fungal life. Fedhas demands that followers encourage the decomposition of corpses. Fedhas forbids followers from harming any species under Fedhas' protection, and from using any necromantic effects that interfere with corpses. In return Fedhas grants a number of abilities that promote the growth of plants and fungi. These abilities may incidentally prove useful to adventurers.
%%%%
Cheibriados

Cheibriados is a god who meditates on the mystery of time. Those who choose to follow this god's path will learn to eschew unnecessary haste, slowing down both themselves and others, and hurt those who refuse to slow down. Especially devout followers may even temporarily abandon the flow of time and its needless disturbances.
%%%%
Ashenzari

While it seems inconceivable that the divine could be shackled, Ashenzari is just that: being purposely nailed to the sky for eternity, the unbudging god is all-knowing, all-seeing. Devoted worshippers are allowed to grasp shreds of this knowledge and foresight, but be warned: to Ashenzari, power and blessing and curse are all the same thing.
%%%%
Jiyva

Jiyva is the chaotic ancient deity of the slimes. Followers are expected to support the spread and satiation of their fellow slimes by allowing them to consume items and are forbidden from harming any slimes. Jiyva will even occasionally consume items left elsewhere in the Dungeon by followers. Especially favoured followers will become as shapeless as their god, as their attributes and mutations shift around under Jiyva's influence.
%%%%
Zin powers

Zin grants followers the ability to preach to the unenlightened masses. With sufficient piety, a starving follower can pray for nutrition. Later, followers will gain powers to purify and strengthen their bodies, and can eventually find temporary safety in a divine refuge. As piety grows, followers will be protected from disease, miasma, mutation and rotting. Apart from that, Zin may occasionally directly intervene to save a follower's life.
%%%%
The Shining One powers

Later, they can channel blasts of cleansing flame that are particularly damaging to unholy beings. Eventually, they can ask the Shining One to send them powerful divine beings as allies. The Shining One may occasionally directly intervene to save a follower's life. With growing piety the Shining One will protect a follower's life force.
%%%%
Kikubaaqudgha powers

Kikubaaqudgha will send corpses to followers, enhance servants' necromantic prowess with gifts of spellbooks, and imbue their weapons with pain. Especially fervent followers can protect themselves from torment, or even invoke it themselves by offering a cadaver to Kikubaaqudgha.
%%%%
Yredelemnul powers

Yredelemnul gives you the power to raise skeletons and corpses to fight on your side, to recall your undead followers to your vicinity, and to heal hit points by draining the life force of living creatures. Eventually, you'll gain the power to bind a monster's soul, and make it fight for you instead. Yredelemnul will sporadically gift you with stronger undead servants. Also, with sufficient piety, Yredelemnul will mirror any injury you have to suffer onto the attacker.
%%%%
Xom powers

To worship Xom is to live riskily. In a good mood Xom may shower you with gifts, while at other times this capricious god could decide to "spice things up a little" and send you to your doom. If you prove yourself the stronger, so much the better; if not, well, there'll be other playthings...
%%%%
# no active powers of Vehumet

%%%%

Nemelex Xobeh powers

The Trickster's followers gain various ways to influence fate when playing cards.
%%%%
Elyvilon powers

The healer god offers followers means to heal themselves from damage and other ill effects. Elyvilon also allows healing of hostile monsters, trying to turn them neutral. The healer god may directly intervene to save a follower's life, especially when called upon; highly pious followers can be sure of such aid.
%%%%
Lugonu powers

Followers of Lugonu gain powers to depart the Abyss at will, to banish monsters there, and eventually to gate themselves into this realm of chaos - at the cost of a part of their soul. Apart from that, they can cause distortional damage to monsters, and gain an ability to corrupt the ordered world, enabling them to open a gate for creatures of the Abyss to pass through.
%%%%
Beogh powers

Beogh encourages followers to make use of orcish gear found in the dungeon. Followers can smite their foes, and will even gain orcish followers of their own, who may be blessed by Beogh in battle and can be recalled within a level as needed. Eventually, they'll gain the power to walk on water. Beogh will sometimes directly intervene to save a follower's life.
%%%%
Fedhas powers

Plants and fungi will not attack Fedhas worshippers without provocation. Fedhas worshippers may walk through plants or fungi, and even fire missiles or spells through them without causing harm. Fedhas grants the ability to promote plants and fungi into stronger species. Followers can eventually grow a wall of plants and create explosive spores from corpses. Followers are granted some control over the weather; they may call sunlight and eventually rainstorms.
%%%%
Cheibriados powers

Followers are rewarded for moving slowly and killing creatures which are faster than they are. Moving too quickly or using magically hastened weapons is frowned upon. Cheibriados rewards the faithful with a slowed metabolism, the power to slow other creatures, the power to harm those who move more quickly than you do and, finally, the ability to step out of the flow of time.
%%%%
Jiyva powers

Followers can request a jelly from Jiyva, turn monsters to slime, and eventually remove their harmful mutations. As their piety grows, Jiyva will, with increasing frequency, drop jellies into the dungeon, rearrange their attributes to favour the attribute last chosen when gaining an experience level, and grant mutation gifts. All slimes will never harm a follower of Jiyva, and Jiyva demands that worshippers do the same. Eventually, all visible slimes will join in on a prayer, preventing them from moving for a while.
%%%%
Ashenzari powers

Ashenzari exhorts followers to garb themselves with curses, rewarding followers for time spent using cursed armour, jewelry, or weapons. Ashenzari's ultimate desire, however, is not for the devotion of followers but for knowledge of all things. Pious followers willing to part with a portion of their knowledge will receive a great portion of Ashenzari's in return.
