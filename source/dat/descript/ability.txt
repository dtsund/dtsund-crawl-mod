%%%%
Breathe Noxious Fumes

Breathe a blast of noxious fumes at a targeted monster.

Bat Form

Turn into a speedy vampire bat. In bat form, you can neither interact with items in any form (except picking them up or dropping them), nor cast spells. Note that Bat Form will decrease your current Strength while increasing your Dexterity. Thus, you won't be able to change form if your Strength is too low.
%%%%

Evoke Berserk Rage

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your hit points and damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, cannot berserk again, and occasionally even pass out.
%%%%
Evoke Invisibility

Turn yourself invisible for a limited amount of time. Turning invisible increases your magical contamination and may eventually cause glowing.
%%%%

%%%%
Stop Levitating

Stop levitating.
%%%%
End Transformation

Revert to your normal form, with a short delay.
%%%%
# Zin
Recite

Preach to monsters about Zin's laws, which can lead to various results. There are four books you can preach from:

* Book of Abominations: This book deals with the very thing most abhorrent to Zin - chaos in all its forms. These recitations will invoke Zin's most powerful smiting.

* Book of Ablutions: The impure are nearly as loathed by the Law-Giver. Recitations from this book will deal damage to such creatures.

* Book of Apostates: Intelligent creatures who do not worship Zin but do no other evil will be dealt with least harshly. The recitations from this book merely sow confusion. Yet those who dare to worship a god alien to Zin may be permanently deprived of means to spread their foul faith.

* Book of Anathema: Demons and the undead are hated by Zin. This book gives you means to rebuke them.
%%%%
Vitalisation

Vitalise yourself. This will remove a negative affliction from you, or restore one of your attributes. In case neither of these is necessary, it will give you temporary boosts to your attributes instead.
%%%%
Imprison

Temporarily imprison a monster surrounded by empty space in rock. It only works on monsters receptive to Recite, as such monsters will feel the effects of Recite once the prison naturally disappears.
%%%%
Sanctuary

For a short duration gain safety in a divine refuge. While you are inside the sanctuary, monsters will not attack you, but the protection will disappear at once should you breach the divine peace.
%%%%
Cure All Mutations

Cure all your mutations - but only once.
%%%%

Conjure up a divine shield that stacks with an ordinary shield and can be used even when wielding a two-handed weapon, as the Divine Shield is managed by the Shining One.

Invoke a huge blast of divine fury centered on you, severely damaging undead and demons. All other hostiles also take damage, if less so, whereas you and your allies are never affected.
%%%%
Summon Divine Warrior

Summon an Angel or Daeva, powerful warriors against evil. They may be blessed by the Shining One to stay longer or even permanently in this world.
%%%%
# Kikubaaqudgha
Receive Corpses

Create one or more reanimatable monster corpses near yourself. The number and freshness of these are dependent on Necromancy skill.
%%%%
Torment

Sacrifice a cadaver to make everyone in sight, including you, experience all the pain that being suffered in its life. This will decimate the resilience of all those who can feel it.

Kikubaaqudgha may choose to protect you from it... or may not.
%%%%
# Yredelemnul

%%%%

%%%%
Drain Life

%%%%
Enslave Soul

Mark a living intelligent monster's soul as ripe for the taking. Once the marked monster dies, its soul will be yours.

The enslaved soul will retain the monster's faculties, equipment and abilities, as well as some of its innate healing. However, only a relatively uninjured monster can have its soul marked, and only one soul can be enslaved at a time. Furthermore, the duration of the mark is dependent on Invocations skill.

Note that enslaved souls can follow you beyond the level they were created on.
%%%%
Animate Remains or Dead

If you get this description, it is a bug.
%%%%
# Okawaru
Heroism

Temporarily increase all of your combat skills, including the ability to sneak around or avoid traps.

%%%%
# Trog
Burn Spellbooks

Set all spellbooks within your field of vision on fire. The fire is fuelled by Trog's hatred, and Trog likes it most when you don't even care which books of madness burst into flames.
%%%%
Berserk

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your hit points and damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, and cannot berserk again. Unlike other sources of rage, depending on your piety Trog may occasionally prevent you from passing out.
%%%%
Trog's Hand

Invoke a powerful regeneration ability which stacks with all other sources and even allows otherwise non-healing species to regenerate. This will also increase protection from magical effects.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms

Summon huge angry allies to wreak havoc.
%%%%
# Elyvilon
Divine Protection

Beseech Elyvilon to save your life. If you are mortally wounded, the Healer may undo the killing blow. Especially pious individuals may be certain of this help, but in that case, any actual intervention costs piety (as opposed to merely asking for intervention, which is always free).

Beware: killing others while asking to be spared yourself is a major sin!
%%%%
Lesser Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a small amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them neutral. This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still worse on other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless creatures cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is asleep. The chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food and magic point are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half the monster's experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Lesser Self-Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a small amount of hit points.
%%%%
Purification

Purge your body of bad effects such as sickness, poisoning, slowness, confusion and rotting.
%%%%
Greater Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a moderate amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them neutral. This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still worse on other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless creatures cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is asleep. The chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power, so it is significantly better than using Lesser Healing.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food, piety and magic points are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half the monster's experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Greater Self-Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a moderate amount of hit points. Roughly, Greater Healing will allow you to heal three times the amount of Lesser Healing at a slightly higher total piety cost.
%%%%
Restoration

Fully restore your Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence, and heal a large amount of rotted hit points.
%%%%
Divine Vigour

Depending on your Invocations skill, restore a large amount of, and temporarily increase, both your hit points and your magic points.

%%%%
Enter the Abyss

Transfer yourself to Lugonu's realm instantly... at a cost.
%%%%
# Nemelex Xobeh
Draw One

Choose any deck in your inventory and draw a card from it.
%%%%

%%%%
Mark Four

Draw four cards from any deck in your inventory, mark and remember them, so that you can tell when they are on top, and shuffle them back into the deck. The deck will be inscribed as containing those cards, and doing so will identify the deck.
%%%%

Draw five cards from any deck in your inventory, losing the rest of the deck. Look at the cards and sort them into any order you'd like. Subsequently, you can draw these cards in the order you chose.
%%%%
# Beogh

%%%%
Recall Orcish Followers

Recall your orcish followers from anywhere on the level to your immediate surroundings.
%%%%
# Fedhas
Sunlight

Call sunlight down over a small area of the dungeon. Monsters illuminated by the light will be easier to hit. Water affected by the sunlight will evaporate. In particular, deep water will become shallow water, and shallow water will dry up completely, revealing the dungeon floor.
%%%%
Growth

Use fruit to grow a ring of plants around yourself. If a complete ring cannot be formed (because you do not have enough fruit), plants will grow on squares adjacent to you that are close to monsters. The plants you create gain bonus HP proportional to your invocations skill.
%%%%
Rain

Cause rain to fall around yourself, turning the dungeon floor into shallow water and shallow water into deep water.
%%%%
Reproduction

Create giant spores from corpses in your line of sight. The spores will explode, causing damage to you or your enemies.
%%%%
Evolution

Turn plants and fungi adjacent to you into stronger species. Upgrading fungi requires piety, upgrading plants requires fruit. Plants upgraded gain a bonus to attack accuracy proportional to the user's invocations skill, and oklob plants are more likely to spit acid at higher invocations.
%%%%
# Cheibriados
Make Ponderous

Alter a piece of body armour of your choice so it slows the wearer down. This is generally bad for hasty people, those who appreciate taking the time may benefit from Cheibriados's favour when they are not so fast.
%%%%
Bend Time

Slow down everyone who's standing just next to you.
%%%%
Slouch

Cause damage to everyone in sight who is moving faster than you. Those magically hasted will be hurt particularly painfully.

%%%%

Renounce your faith. This will make your character leave your god (and usually anger said god).
%%%%
