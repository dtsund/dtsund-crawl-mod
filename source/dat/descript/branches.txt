Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it is the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped by all kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No matter what the origin of this cave is, it is filled with riches unheard of as well as with ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and even fewer have kept some rest of sanity to tell the tale.

The dungeon is 27 levels deep, but, honestly, this is only the beginning.
%%%%
Temple

A Temple of Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the insanity of the dungeon. It is located between the levels 4 and 7 of the main dungeon.

%%%%

%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the Lair of Beasts to be an exciting change of climate. And indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and eaten rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.

%%%%
Shoals

From afar you hear the steady sounds of waves and smell the salty spray. Upon reaching the Shoals, you are impressed by exotic underground beaches, making up a few islands in a vast sea. Out of a sudden, a bloodcurdling scream fills the air, followed by a gurgle. Anxiously, you look around and wonder: Who is the predator? And who is the prey?

The Shoals are five levels deep and contain the barnacled rune. A dungeon features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp and Shoals branches. If the Shoals are present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.

%%%%
Hall of Blades

Once upon a time, all the daggers and axes and polearms would gather at the time of night and dance the waltz, dreaming of battlefields void of man and beast. That time is no more, yet the weapons are still there.

Pandemonium is endless. Portals there are found abundantly in the deeper parts of the main dungeon. Note that getting back might be more difficult.
%%%%
Abyss

The Abyss is a truly bizarre place, ever-changing and twisted. It is filled with all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature, whose common aim is to feast on intruders. It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who delight in sending would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of madness. Reportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems to concoct schemes around this place and its denizens.

The Abyss can be purposefully reached through portals in the deeper levels of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Zot

A region of the dungeon complex, safely locked away and referred to usually by madness, frenzy, lunacy. Only the most demented adventurers would dare to break the seal and press deeper - in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no one has ever laid eyes on before.
