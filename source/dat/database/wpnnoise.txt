# As of Stone Soup 0.3 the previously hardcoded monster

# messages, and adding new ones really easy.
#
# wpnnoise.txt contains the messages of randart weapons with
# the noise property and of the noisy unrandart weapons,
# like the Singing Sword. To make an entry for a noisy
# unrandart weapon, make the entry's key exactly the same as
# the weapon's name, but all lower case.

# For an explanation of how to read wpnnoise.txt and how to
# add new messages, see monster_speech.txt in the
