Tomb

"In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror, imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain."
    -Nathaniel Hawthorne

A gateway to Hell

"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

%%%%
A granite statue

"I met a traveller from an antique land
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
 Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
 Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown
 And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
 Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,
 The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
 And on the pedestal these words appear:
 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
 Nothing beside remains: round the decay
 Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
 The lone and level sands stretch far away."
    -Percy Bysshe Shelley, "Ozymandias". 1818.

A labyrinth entrance

"Maze-treaders, whose vision ahead and behind is severely constricted and fragmented, suffer confusion, whereas maze-viewers who see the pattern whole, from above or in a diagram, are dazzled by its complex artistry. What you see depends on where you stand, and thus, at one and the same time, labyrinths are single (there is one physical structure) and double: they simultaneously incorporate order and disorder, clarity and confusion, unity and multiplicity, artistry and chaos."

"'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound."
    -Charles Dickens, "Oliver Twist"

A rock wall

"I know not whether Laws be right,

When fresh it is filled with a white almost transparent, sweet, jelly-like pulp in which lies a rather large, shining, brown seed; the pulp is of a delicious sub-acid flavour when fresh. The Chinese dry it when it becomes black like a prune and thus preserve it for use throughout the year; in this state it is frequently to be seen in the London fruit shops."

But you find on inquiring into the 'particulars within' the outer coat, that there is concealed beneath the red and hairy covering a semi-transparent pulp of a pleasant acid taste, enveloping a single oval and oblong seed. I know not but I am peculiar in my memory of the beautiful fruits of the straits, but none lingers in my recollection so sweetly in its clustered beauties of the fruit-dish as the bearded and rosy rambutan."

"When Peleus, some distance away, saw him torn apart by the frightful wound he shouted: 'Accept this tribute to the dead, at least, Crantor, dearest of youths, ' and with his powerful arm, he hurled his ash spear, at full strength, at Demoleon. It ruptured the ribcage, and stuck quivering in the bone. The centaur pulled out the shaft minus its head (he tried with difficulty to reach that also) but the head was caught in his lung. The pain itself strengthened his will: wounded, he reared up at his enemy and beat the hero down with his hooves. Peleus received the resounding blows on helmet and shield, and defending his upper arms, and controlling the weapon he held out, with one blow through the arm he pierced the bi-formed breast.'"

Once the Rabbi forgot this duty, all were in the Synagogue, the Sabbath hymn was begun, when all the women and children in the assembly started and screamed out, 'the Golem! the Golem is destroying everything!' The Rabbi ordered the precentor to pause at the end of the prayer: it was yet possible to save all, but later nought would avail, the whole world would be destroyed. He hastened home, and saw the Golem already seizing the joists of his house to tear down the building: he sprang forward, took the parchment out, and dead clay again lay at his feet."

"Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying. As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise. Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone through its ears, turning them pink. "He's yours," said Mr. Arable. "Saved from an untimely death. And may the good Lord forgive me for this foolishness."

kraken

"... Kraken, also called the Crab-fish, which [according to the pilots of Norway] is not that huge, for heads and tails counted, he is no larger than our Öland is wide [i.e. less than 16 km] ... He stays at the sea floor, constantly surrounded by innumerable small fishes, who serve as his food and are fed by him in return: for his meal, if I remember correctly what E. Pontoppidan writes, lasts no longer than three months, and another three are then needed to digest it. His excrements nurture in the following an army of lesser fish, and for this reason, fishermen plumb after his resting place ... Gradually, Kraken ascends to the surface, and when he is at ten to twelve fathoms, the boats had better move out of his vicinity, as he will shortly thereafter burst up, like a floating island, spurting water from his dreadful nostrils and making ring waves around him, which can reach many miles. Could one doubt that this is the Leviathan of Job?"

Mara

"This night the Lord of Illusion passed among you, Mara, mighty among dreamers, mighty for ill. He did come upon another who may work with the stuff of dreams in a different way. He did meet with Dharma, who may expel a dreamer from his dream. They did struggle, and the Lord Mara is no more. Why did they struggle, deathgod against illusionist? You say their ways are incomprehensible, being the ways of gods. This is not the answer."

"Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king!
 I go, and I return not. But the will

 Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil
 Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise,
 The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days."

"Ctesias writeth, that in Aethiopia likewise there is a beast which he calleth Mantichora, having three rankes of teeth, which when they meet togither are let in one within another like the teeth of combes: with the face and eares of a man, with red eyes; of colour sanguine, bodied like a lyon, and having a taile armed with a sting like a scorpion: his voice resembleth the noise of a flute and trumpet sounded together: very swift he is, and mans flesh of all others hee most desireth."

mermaid

"To the Sirens first shalt thou come, who beguile all men whosoever comes to them. Whoso in ignorance draws near to them and hears the Sirens' voice, he nevermore returns, that his wife and little children may stand at his side rejoicing, but the Sirens beguile him with their clear-toned song, as they sit in a meadow, and about them is a great heap of bones of mouldering men, and round the bones the skin is shrivelling."

mummy

"I see Egypt and the Egyptians -- I see the pyramids and obelisks;
 I look on chisel'd histories, songs, philosophies, cut in slabs

 I see at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mummies, embalm'd, swathed
     in linen cloth, lying there many centuries;
 I look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping
     neck, the hands folded across the breast."

"As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside
 each creature with its four faces. This was the appearance and structure
 of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike.
 Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. As they
 moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced;
 the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went. Their rims were
 high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around."
