# monname.txt: lookup monster names
#
# This file contains a list of names for monster names.
# This is currently only used when one of your orcish followers as
# Beogh's messiah gets named by Beogh.
#
# Some important syllables
#   beogh, bog = referring to Beogh
#   ork, orc, org, og, ok etc. = referring to orcs
#
# Other syllables may be borrowed from real life, or made up.
#
# To determine a name for an orcish follower, the game first looks
# looks for this follower's specific type, followed by the key word
# "name", e.g. "orc warrior name" or "orc sorcerer name". If no name
# has been found, the genus "orc" is tried instead. Should that also
# fail, plain orcs as well as followers of professions that have not
# been defined, won't ever be named.
#
# A name, once chosen, is final. In particular, Blork and Urug cannot
# be renamed. Also, note that plain orcs can grow up to be warriors
# and follow the fighter route, or else be blessed by Beogh to become
# priests. Either way, if already named, they will keep their name.
#
# Feel free to add to this list. Like for the other database lists,
# you may add weights (defaults to w:10) to make certain names more
# or less likely.
