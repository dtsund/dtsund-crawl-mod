# Randart Names
# -------------
# randname.txt: lookup randart type
#
# This file contains the lists of keywords (and their weights) for some lookup
# phrases of randart type, namely "weapon", "armour" and "jewellery" as well
# as in combination with those gods that occasionally gift randarts, i.e.
# "Trog weapon", "Okawaru weapon", "Okawaru armour", "Xom weapon", "Xom armour"
# and "Xom jewellery". Incidentally, they are listed in precisely that order.
# At the end of the file you will also find a few lists of adjectives used for
# unidentified randart appearances.
#
# The syntax for keywords is the same as that of monster speech (details are in
# docs/develop/monster_speech.txt). Any phrase encased in '@' symbols is one
# the database will recognise as a keyword that needs to be replaced.
# Definitions of such keywords can be found in 4 different places:
#
#  o  rand_wpn.txt  - keywords used mainly for weapons
#  o  rand_arm.txt  - keywords used mainly for armour
#  o  rand_all.txt  - keywords used for jewellery
#                     as well as for all three types
#  o  randbook.txt  - keywords used for randart books
#  o  hardcoded (e.g. artefact.cc)
#
# The latter allows the use of phrases elsewhere defined in Crawl. The list of
# hardcoded keywords is as follows:
#
#  * player_name     - player-chosen character name
#  * player_species  - species of the character
#  * branch_name     - name of a random Crawl branch
#  * god_name        - name of a random Crawl god
#  * xom_name        - one of Xom's long names
#
# In the case of god_name this actually allows some more refined handling. In
# fact, the god will not be picked entirely at random as there are some
# restrictions to make sure that e.g. no good god is chosen for evil weapons,
# that Beogh isn't matched with orc slaying, or that Zin doesn't get picked for
# randarts with mutagenic properties. Also, if this keyword appears on a divine
# item gift it will always be replaced by the god doing the gifting.
#
# Randart names may only have a maximum length of 25 symbols (spaces included).
# This comparison takes place after all replacements have been taken care of,
# and the name is thus complete. If a name turns out to be longer than this
# threshold, the game will roll another one.
#
# Note that weapons and armour use database names for only half of all randarts
# created (the others are entirely random names), for jewellery this is only
# the case for one in five randarts. These chances are hardcoded.
#
# Feel free to play around with the keywords or their weights. The default
# weight of an entry is w:10, and an entry is picked with a chance of its
# weight out of the sum of all weights for entries in a group. Consequently if
# you set the weight of a keyword to a really high value (say, 10,000) you can
# test how it looks in the game. Even better, if you have wizard mode compiled
# in (check in-game '?V' version information) you can use the wizard command
# '&o' to create objects and '&+' to turn an ordinary object into a randart.
#
# Have fun!

# Jewellery appearance
######################################################
#
# While for the appearance of randart weapons and armour you can just stick an
# adjective in front of the object type name ("bloodstained dagger"),
# unidentified non-artefact jewellery is described with both an adjective and
# material ("runed wooden ring"), making a description like "runed ring" a bit
# weird. So give randart jewellery an adjective that no non-artefact jewellery
# would have, plus a material that a non-artefact might or might not have.
