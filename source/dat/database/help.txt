pick-up

                   <h>Picking up and dropping items</h>
<h>Item letters</h>
Pressing an item's letter key will select the item.
Entering a number before the letter will only select that quantity.

<h>Regular expressions</h>
You can press <w>Ctrl-F</w> to enter a word (or a regular expression).
All matching items will be selected.

<h>Cursor</h>
There are shortcuts to quickly select several items in succession:
<w>.</w>   selects the next item and moves the cursor down
<w>'</w>   moves the cursor down without changing selection
The cursor is usually hidden; pressing <w>.</w> or <w>'</w> makes it appear.

<h>Category shortcuts</w>
You can quickly select items by type by pressing:
<w>!</w>   potions      <w>(</w>   weapons         <w>[</w>   armour       <w>=</w> or <w>"</w>   jewellery
<w>?</w>   scrolls      <w>)</w>   ammunition      <w>/</w>   wands        <w>:</w> or <w>+</w>   books
<w>%</w>   food         <w>&</w>   carrion (corpses, skeletons, useless chunks)
Global selects:  <w>,</w>   select all      <w>*</w>   invert all        <w>-</w>   deselect all
Note that for dropping, the <w>,</w> command uses the <w>drop_filter</w> option, which
narrows the range of items to be (de)selected. The default are useless items.

stash-search.prompt

<h>Searching the stash-tracker</h>

You can search for items and dungeon features by name (or a substring of the
name). In the list of search results, you can select a search result by its
hotkey to travel to its location.

You can also examine shops and items in the search results by pressing <w>?</w> and
then hitting the hotkey for the search result. This will give a description
of the item or the contents of the shop.

Some examples of search strings:
<w>cure mutation</w> find all potions of cure mutation, including potions in shops.
<w>jell</w>          finds every single royal jelly and heaps of royal jellies
<w>Lair:2</w>        find everything known to be on Lair:2.
<w>D:[2-4]</w>       finds everything on Dungeon levels 2-4. Regexes are allowed!
              Note that D:[3-10] will not work as intended, since [x-y] is a
              regex character range.
<w>.</w>             is a shortcut to find everything on your current level.
<w>..</w>            is a shortcut for listing all items you know.
<w>Lair.*axe</w> and <w>axe && Lair</w> both show all axes in the Lair.

The stash search string is case-insensitive.


<h>Searching by item properties:</h>

You can search for spell names (such as <w>Ignite Poison</w>) to find spellbooks
or rods that contain the spell.

You can search for artefact item properties (such as <w>prevents.*teleport</w>)
to find artefacts that have the property.

If you're using stash.lua (which is the default), you can also search by
some additional item properties: <w>artefact</w> will find identified artefacts.
Skill names (such as <w>Polearms</w> or <w>Long Blades</w>) will find all weapons that
train that skill.

If you're using stash.lua and have set annotate_item_class = true in your
initfile, you can also search by item types such as <w>book</w> or <w>jewellery</w>.


<h>Finding Dungeon Features:</h>

You can search for dungeon features by name: all shops will be found by a
search for <w>shop</w> (including shops that do not have "shop" in their name);
other dungeon features can also be found by name: <w>fountain</w>, <w>axe trap</w>,
<w>altar</w>, etc. You can also search for altars by deity name: <w>Zin</w>.


<h>Non-regex operators:</h>

You can use !! to negate a search string, && for a boolean AND, || for
boolean OR, and <<<< >> for grouping.

For instance, to find rings (jewellery) but not ring mail you could use:
<w>ring && !!mail</w>
