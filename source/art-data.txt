# This file contains the definitions of undrandarts (and what used to be
# fixed artefacts).  util/art-data.pl translates this file into
# art-data.h, and also updates the enumeration and NO_UNRANDARTS in
# artefact.h.  C/C++ functions which give unrandarts non-standard
# behaviour are in art-func.h; util/art-data.pl scans art-func.h and
# puts the function names found into art-data.h.
#
# Each artefact definition is separated by one or more blank lines.
#
# Each artefact definition must have the NAME, APPEAR, OBJ and COLOUR
# fields.
#
# The name and appearance of each unrandart must be unique.
#
# Changing the name of an unrand will change its automatically
# generated enumeration, unless its enumeration is forced with ENUM.
#
# "ENUM: FOO" can be used to force the enumeration for an unrand to be
# "UNRAND_FOO", for cases where the automatically generated enumerations
# of different unrandarts conflict.
#
# Add new artefact definitions at the end of the file; doing so should cause
# no problems with save-file compatibilty, but for tile builds it will
# cause a shift of remembered tiles (since each new unrandart needs its
# own tiles).  Changing the order of the definitions will likely cause
# strange behaviour in games saved previous to the change, and deleting
# definitions will break savefile compatibility.
#
# ####### TILES #############################
#
# Each unrandart needs at the very least an item tile, and weapons and armour
# also need an equipment tile for the player doll. For the former, you can
# define the image file within this file using the keyword TILE. The files are
# assumed to be png and the syntax does not include the file type. The
# artefacts' base type decides where a tile needs to be placed. These are as
# follows:
#     Weapons: rltiles/item/weapon/artefact
#     Armour:  rltiles/item/armour/artefact
#     Rings:   rltiles/item/ring/artefact
#     Amulets: rltiles/item/amulet/artefact
#
# If the tile requires a black outline (because it would be hard to see
# otherwise) add "tilerim" to the artefact's boolean properties. Otherwise
# the image is used without modification.
#
# For the equipment tile, place the tile into the appropriate subdirectory of
# rltiles/player/ and define it in rltiles/dc-player.txt as well as here, using
# the keyword TILE_EQ. Tiles are sorted into directories by equipment slot:
#     Weapons:     rltiles/player/hand1/artefact
#     Body armour: rltiles/player/body
#     Boots:       rltiles/player/boots
#     Cloaks:      rltiles/player/cloak
#     Gloves:      rltiles/player/gloves
#     Shields:     rltiles/player/hand2
#     Helms, caps: rltiles/player/head
#
# Rings and amulets are too small to be displayed with the player doll.
#
# To begin with, placeholders (e.g. the base type tiles) are fine, but they'll
# eventually need to be replaced with proper tiles, though this is less of a
# problem for the equipment tiles.
# No checks are made for whether path or files actually exist. However, if that
# is not the case the tile compilation will fail.

# Explanation of unusual fields:

# BOOL: Turn certain boolean properties of the artefact on, with the list
# of properties separated by commas.  The list includes:
#
# * berserk:  Lets wearer evoke berserking ability.
# * blink:    Lets wearer evoke the blink ability.
# * chaotic:  Is treated as a chaotic item.
# * cursed:   Item is generated cursed.
# * elec:     Grants electrical resistance.
# * evil:     Is treated as an evil item.
# * holy:     Is treated as a holy item.
# * inv:      Lets wearer evoke invisibility ability.
# * lev:      Lets wearer evoke levitation ability.
# * life:     Grants negative energy resistance.
# * noises:   Weapon makes noises.  Can be given its own set of noises by
#             making an entry in dat/database/wpnnoise.txt, with the
#             entry's key exactly the same as the weapon's name, but all
#             lowercase.
# * nospell:  Prevents wearer from casting spells.
# * notelep:  Prevents wearer from teleporting or blinking.
# * poison:   Grants poison resistance.
# * rnd_tele: Induces random teleportation.
# * seeinv:   Lets wearer see invisible.
# * special:  Artefact is "special": can't be picked up by monsters,
#             can't be affected by Tukima's Dance, generated less
#             frequently than normal randarts, can be generated in the
#             Abyss if its been lost elsewhere.
# * tilerim:  Adds a black outline to the tile, see above section.

# ENUM: Forces the artefact's enumeration literal to something specific.
# For example, "ENUM: FOO" gives the enumeration "UNRAND_FOO".  The
# default enumeration is determined as follows:
#
# 1) If there's a string between double quotes, use that.
# 2) If #1 doesn't apply and the name contains " of " or " of the ",
#    use what's after that.
# 3) If neither #1 no #2 apply, use the full name.
# 4) Remove apostrophes, change spaces and dashes to underscores,
#    uppercase the whole thing, and add "UNRAND_" to the front.

# OBJ: The enumerations of the base type and sub type of the artefact,
# separated by a dash.  E.g., OBJ_WEAPONS/WPN_SWORD

# PLUS: The pluses of the artefact.  For an object with two pluses,
# this is specified with "plus/plus2".  For an object with just one plus,
# this is specified with "plus".

# APPEAR:   Unidentified appearance of artifact.
# COLD:     Cold resistance/vulnerability.
# COLOUR:   The colour of the artifact, either as listed in defines.h
#           (e.g., LIGHTRED) or as listed under element_type in view.h
#           (e.g., ETC_FIRE)
# CURSED:   The artefact has a one-in-num chance of becoming cursed each
#           time it's equipped.
# DAM:      Damage modifier (for non-weapon artefacts).
# DESC:     Description which replaces the database (dat/descript/items.txt)
#           description of the item.
# DESC_ID:  Description which replaces the database desc or DESC when the

# TILE_EQ:  The file containing the equipment tile for the player doll as
#           defined in rltiles/dc-player.txt. See Tiles section above.
# VALUE:    item_value() will return this number instead of doing automatic

DESC_ID: It is the creation of a mad god, and carries a curse which
         transforms anyone possessing it into a prune. Fortunately, the
         curse works very slowly, and one can use it briefly with no
         consequences worse than slightly purple skin and a few wrinkles.

DESC_ID: It was the magical weapon wielded by the mighty wizard Olgreb
         before he met his fate somewhere within these dungeons. It
         increases the ability of its wielder to use venomous magic, and
         carries magical powers which can be evoked.
         The tales say that Olgreb researched rare venoms that may have
         some limited effect even on creatures immune to all commonly known
         poisons.
