Probably-easy TODO list:
	Remove Felids, because boring(?)
	Remove Labyrinths, because boring(?)
	Rename Megabat?
	Consequently, rework Stalker.  Book of Stalking will be like Book of Minor Magic, full of
	low-level but useful spells, just for a stealthy battlemage.
		New book: Corona, Fulsome Distillation, Evaporate, Blink, Ensorcelled Hibernation, Passwall?
		Skills: 1 Fighting, 1 Short Blades, 3 Stealth, 2 Dodging, 2 Spellcasting, 1 Sorcery, 1 Tmut, 1 Tloc.  
			Book is implemented, just need to redo the skills.
	Xom should mess up menu text occasionally for his followers (not to an untelligible extent, though)


Harder TODO list:
	Redo scoring system to induce experts to play hyperagressively
	Phase out paralysis in favor of a suite of new status effects
	Restore square spell ranges (This actually looks really hard)
	Reduce game length by 1/3 outside of extended endgame
		There are subtle balance issues involved!
	Tweak silent spectre, give Mennas a few holy-flavored ones as pets
		Specifically: Reduce spectre melee attack to negligible levels,
		give them crazy speed, have them cast Silence rather than keep
		a permanent aura.  Skeletal warrior packs past a certain point
		get a chance at having them.
	Nerf Mennas' defense.  Make him rely on his pets for Silence.
	Make Shoals a portal vault
	Make Invisibility more viable late-game/extended
		Reduce some See Invisible enemies to merely Sense Invisible, or no
		invisibility detection at all


Changes already made:
	Monsters may no longer invoke Zot traps against the player.
	Charms, Hexes, and Poison Magic reshuffled into Enchantments and Sorcery.  Some books consequently changed.
		May need to reconsider a species aptitude or two, but this isn't urgent.
	Haste and Slow nerf reverted.
	Crude hack in mon-place.cc to make Mennas not spawn.  Will remove when Mennas tweaked.
	Spell success rate now shown as an actual percentage, not an adjective.  Success >= 98% rounded up to 100%.
	Replaced Silence with Haste in the book of War Chants.
	Replaced Repel Missiles with Throw Frost in book of Minor Magic.
	Selective Amnesia restored as a spell.  Now found in the books of Wizardry, Enchantments, and Dreams.
	Give Assassins more needles (might revert if OP).  Now get 5 each of sleep, slow, confusion.
	Remove Shoals from early Lair lottery (kludgy, just rigged the lottery).
	Acquirement now shows the exact items the player is choosing from.
		Flaw(?) with current implementation: I think unrands that get generated
		and rejected don't get a second chance to generate.
		
		Also can't see ring bonii if int/str/dex without examination, but this is minor
		(who'd spend an acquirement on one anyway?)
	Skill can now automatically be trained without victory dancing (interface is different from vanilla trunk).
	Manuals now increase the associated skill by 3 levels and disintegrate immediately.
	The Stalker background has been reworked; now emphasizes useful low level spells.
