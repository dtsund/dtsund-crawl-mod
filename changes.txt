Probably-easy TODO list:
	Update the manual.
	Revert Sticky Flame nerf
	Make Sorcery appear above the elemental schools in skills menu, maybe next to Enchantments.
	Update the randart spellbook name generator.
	"That beam is likely to hit you" for Fire Storm and Ice Storm, LRD, Major Destruction
	Casting LRD at a pandemonium vault wall resulted in 
		"[string "global_prelude"]:64: attempt to index local 'vault' (a nil value)"


Harder TODO list:
	Put a HP-indicator face next to the player's large HP bar, to make the new system more intuitive
	Need better intro images!
	Locate the section of code sending a background color control sequence, make it optional.
		This because Gnome terminal is a dumb.


Long-term TODO list:
	Add [a]bilities and success rates to the morgue file.
	Merge Traps & Doors with Stealth, making Thievery
	Redo scoring system to induce experts to play hyperagressively
	Phase out paralysis in favor of a suite of new status effects
	Restore square spell ranges (This actually looks really hard)
	Reduce game length by 1/3 outside of extended endgame
		There are subtle balance issues involved!
	Fix the Shoals.
	Make Invisibility more viable late-game/extended
		Reduce some See Invisible enemies to merely Sense Invisible, or no
		invisibility detection at all
	Overhaul some gods.
	Switch to an automatic build system, like autotools, cmake, something like that.
		Hopefully, this will resolve OS X compatibility.


Changes already made:
	Monsters may no longer invoke Zot traps against the player.
	Charms, Hexes, and Poison Magic reshuffled into Enchantments and Sorcery.  Some books consequently changed; miscast effects tweaked.
		Aptitude changes:
			High Elf:
				-2 Poison Magic to 1 Sorcery (Yes, I know this is a buff.)
			Halfling:
				0 Enchantments to -1; -1 Poison Magic to 0 Sorcery.
			Centaur:
				-2 Poison Magic to -1 Sorcery
			Spriggan:
				0 Poison Magic to +2 Sorcery
			Vampire:
				1 Enchantments to 0; -1 Poison Magic to 1 Sorcery.
	Haste and Slow nerf reverted.
	Spell success rate now shown as an actual percentage, not an adjective.  Success >= 98% rounded up to 100%.
	Replaced Silence with Haste in the book of War Chants.
	Replaced Repel Missiles with Throw Frost in book of Minor Magic.
	Selective Amnesia restored as a spell.  Now found in the books of Wizardry, Enchantments, and Dreams.
	Give Assassins more needles (might revert if OP).  Now get 5 each of sleep, slow, confusion.
	Fighters now start with better weapons, to make them a more desirable choice.
	Monks now have a +3,+0 ring of slaying, so players have a reason to not just choose Transmuter instead
		Analyze to-hit mechanics, come up with better enchantment
	Gladiators have had their buckler removed in favor or stronger ranged capabilities
	Bow, crossbow, and sling Hunters get more ammo, so there is a reason to choose them over Arcane Marksman
	Acquirement now shows the exact items the player is choosing from.
		Flaw(?) with current implementation: I think unrands that get generated
		and rejected don't get a second chance to generate.
		
		Also can't see ring bonii if int/str/dex without examination, but this is minor
		(who'd spend an acquirement on one anyway?)
	Skill can now automatically be trained without victory dancing (interface is different from vanilla trunk).
	Manuals now increase the associated skill by 3 levels and disintegrate immediately.
	The Stalker background has been reworked; now emphasizes useful low level spells.
	Every spellbook now has its own unique description.
	Monster HP bars have been replaced with icons that don't mislead the player.
	Felids may no longer be chosen as a player race.
	Okawaru nerf reverted.
	Misc acquirement replaced with potion acquirement.
	Reverted the crystal ball of energy nerf.
	Made silent spectres more interesting; very fast but weak, like mega-megabats with the Silence spell.
		Currently these have 4 HD, may need to change this.
	Skeletal warrior packs have a decent chance of having a silent spectre, very small chance of more than one.
	Mennas has four holy-flavored silent spectres in his group, but can no longer cast Silence himself.
		Also lowered his evasion from 28 to 20, replaced his large shield with a medium shield.
	"Monstrous" demonspawn disabled for now.
	Autoexplore now fails if Str, Dex, or Int is at fatally low levels.
	The halo surrounding TSO followers and divine beings is now visible when using tiles.
	Megabat description updated.
	Shoals removed, pending fixing of tiles version, gameplay tweaking.
	Special-case message for slicing door mimics
	Toned down the vampire mosquito Swamp entrance vault
