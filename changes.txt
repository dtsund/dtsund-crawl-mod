Changes made:
	Monsters may no longer invoke Zot traps against the player
	Charms and Hexes re-merged into Enchantments (possibly pending some more reshuffling)
	Haste and Slow unnerfed.
	Crude hack in mon-place.cc to make Mennas not spawn.  Possibly remove if Mennas tweaked.
	Spell success rate shown as an actual percentage, not an adjective.  Success >= 98% rounded up to 100%.
	Replace Silence with Haste in the book of War Chants
	Replace Repel Missiles with Throw Frost in book of Minor Magic
	Selective Amnesia restored as a spell.  Now found in Wizardry, Enchantments, and Dreams.
	Give Assassins many kinds of needle (might revert if OP).  Now get 3 each of sleep, slow, confusion.
	Remove Shoals from early Lair lottery (kludgy, just rigged the lottery)
	Have acquirement show the exact items the player is choosing from
		Flaw(?) with current implementation: I think unrands that get generated
		and rejected don't get a second chance to generate.

		Also can't see ring bonii if int/str/dex without examination, but this is minor
		(who'd spend an acquirement on one anyway?)
