Probably-easy TODO list:
	Remove Felids, because boring(?)
	Remove Troves and Labyrinths, because boring(?)
	Bump Slow back up to level 3 (OR level 2 Ench/Sorc)
	Rename Poison Magic to Sorcery, reschool some of the more Hex-like spells to it
		More generally, Sorcery could be a school focused on underhanded play and weaknesses
	Rename Megabat?
	Make Passwall Earth/Translocations, put it in the Book of Spatial Translocations (replacing Recall)
	Xom should mess up menu text occasionally for his followers (not to an untelligible extent, though)


Harder TODO list:
	Redo scoring system to induce experts to play hyperagressively
	Phase out paralysis in favor of a suite of new status effects
	Restore square spell ranges (This actually looks really hard)
	Reduce game length by 1/3 outside of extended endgame
		There are subtle balance issues involved!
	Tweak silent spectre, give Mennas a few holy-flavored ones as pets
		Specifically: Reduce spectre melee attack to negligible levels,
		give them crazy speed, have them cast Silence rather than keep
		a permanent aura.  Skeletal warrior packs past a certain point
		get a chance at having them.
	Nerf Mennas' defense.  Make him rely on his pets for Silence.
	Make Shoals a portal vault
	Skill autotraining?  Maybe just wait for the DevTeam to implement it and merge in.
		Change manuals so that they boost a skill by a few levels and immediately disintegrate.
	Make Invisibility more viable late-game/extended
		Reduce some See Invisible enemies to merely Sense Invisible, or no
		invisibility detection at all


Changes already made:
	Monsters may no longer invoke Zot traps against the player
	Charms and Hexes re-merged into Enchantments (pending some reshuffling)
	Unnerf Haste and Slow
	Crude hack in mon-place.cc to make Mennas not spawn.  Remove when Mennas tweaked.
	Spell success rate shown as an actual percentage, not an adjective.  Success >= 98% rounded up to 100%.
	Replace Silence with Haste in the book of War Chants
	Replace Repel Missiles with Throw Frost in book of Minor Magic
	Selective Amnesia restored as a spell.  Now found in Wizardry, Enchantments, and Dreams.
	Give Assassins many kinds of needle (might revert if OP).  Now get 5 each of sleep, slow, confusion.
	Remove Shoals from early Lair lottery (kludgy, just rigged the lottery)
	Have acquirement show the exact items the player is choosing from
		Flaw(?) with current implementation: I think unrands that get generated
		and rejected don't get a second chance to generate.
		
		Also can't see ring bonii if int/str/dex without examination, but this is minor
		(who'd spend an acquirement on one anyway?)
	Skill can now be automatically be trained without victory dancing (interface is different from vanilla trunk)
