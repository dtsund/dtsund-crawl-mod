Probably-easy TODO list:
	Tweak Sorcery miscast effects (maybe have one be a magic resistance halving)
	Remove 'monstrous' demonspawn


Harder TODO list:
	Tweak silent spectre, give Mennas a few holy-flavored ones as pets
		Specifically: Reduce spectre melee attack to negligible levels,
		give them crazy speed, have them cast Silence rather than keep
		a permanent aura.  Skeletal warrior packs past a certain point
		get a chance at having them.
	Nerf Mennas' defense.  Make him rely on his pets for Silence.
	Make Invisibility more viable late-game/extended
		Reduce some See Invisible enemies to merely Sense Invisible, or no
		invisibility detection at all
	Put a HP-indicator face next to the player's large HP bar, to make the new system more intuitive


Long-term TODO list:
	Redo scoring system to induce experts to play hyperagressively
	Phase out paralysis in favor of a suite of new status effects
	Restore square spell ranges (This actually looks really hard)
	Reduce game length by 1/3 outside of extended endgame
		There are subtle balance issues involved!
	Make Shoals a portal vault, possibly replacing labyrinths?
		

Changes already made:
	Monsters may no longer invoke Zot traps against the player.
	Charms, Hexes, and Poison Magic reshuffled into Enchantments and Sorcery.  Some books consequently changed.
		Aptitude changes:
			High Elf:
				-2 Poison Magic to 1 Sorcery (Yes, I know this is a buff.)
			Halfling:
				0 Enchantments to -1; -1 Poison Magic to 0 Sorcery.
			Centaur:
				-2 Poison Magic to -1 Sorcery
			Spriggan:
				0 Poison Magic to +2 Sorcery
			Vampire:
				1 Enchantments to 0; -1 Poison Magic to 1 Sorcery.
	Haste and Slow nerf reverted.
	Crude hack in mon-place.cc to make Mennas not spawn.  Will remove when Mennas tweaked.
	Spell success rate now shown as an actual percentage, not an adjective.  Success >= 98% rounded up to 100%.
	Replaced Silence with Haste in the book of War Chants.
	Replaced Repel Missiles with Throw Frost in book of Minor Magic.
	Selective Amnesia restored as a spell.  Now found in the books of Wizardry, Enchantments, and Dreams.
	Give Assassins more needles (might revert if OP).  Now get 5 each of sleep, slow, confusion.
	Acquirement now shows the exact items the player is choosing from.
		Flaw(?) with current implementation: I think unrands that get generated
		and rejected don't get a second chance to generate.
		
		Also can't see ring bonii if int/str/dex without examination, but this is minor
		(who'd spend an acquirement on one anyway?)
	Skill can now automatically be trained without victory dancing (interface is different from vanilla trunk).
	Manuals now increase the associated skill by 3 levels and disintegrate immediately.
	The Stalker background has been reworked; now emphasizes useful low level spells.
	Every spellbook now has its own unique description.
	Monster HP bars have been replaced with icons that don't mislead the player.
	Felids may no longer be chosen as a player race.
	Okawaru nerf reverted.
	Misc acquirement replaced with potion acquirement.
	Reverted the crystal ball of energy nerf.
